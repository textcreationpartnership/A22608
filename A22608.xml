            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Nder the reigne of our great HENRY, the valorous father of our invincible Monarch, there lived in France a young Lord, whoſe Heroick Nobleneſſe was more recommended through the glory of his Vertue, than by the antiquity of his Race: Hee was called <hi>Cleander;</hi> rich both in the goods of Fortune and Nature; being no leſſe beloved for his Beauty, than feared for his Valour. If hee were valiant, hee was alſo more wiſe; and if hee were wiſe, hee was alſo more happy. But his chiefeſt happineſſe was in his marriage: for in his firſt youth his merits had gained him a wife, one of the faireſt that France ever brought forth. The Eaſt had never ſo many Pearles as ſhee had Beauties, and the morning did bluſh to behold any thing fairer; ſhe was called <hi>Caliſta</hi>: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7258:4"/>
was there any thing wanting but an apt name to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe her perfections. With this woman did <hi>Cleander</hi> paſſe the ſweeteſt life that ever fell into mans imagination; enjoying a happineſſe which cannot bee comprehended but by mindes capable of the glory of ſuch thoughts. The Sunne did never looke upon the earth, but he beheld theſe two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers embracing; Neither did night ever kindle ſo many fires in Heaven, as they felt within their ſoules. Their deſires were not like unto thoſe which were drowned in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but contrariwiſe, their loves were ſharpned by enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for the more they did poſſeſſe that which they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the more they did deſire that which they did poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe.</p>
            <p>But darke night followed this bright day, and this cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was clouded; yea, even whilſt <hi>Cleander</hi> made the earth envious, and the heavens jealous of the favours hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his Miſtreſſe: There was another Knight cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Liſander,</hi> who in courteſie and valour gave place to none of his yeares, who had beheld <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s excellent beautie; with the lightning whereof hee was ſo amazed, that hee cleane loſt the remembrance of himſelfe. Hee was now no more that <hi>Liſander,</hi> whoſe free and warlike mind was wont to apprehend no diſturbance but ambition; for in ſtead of breathing forth an honourable deſire of glory, hee was ſo poſſeſt with the <hi>Idea</hi> of this perfection, that it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to receive any other thought; nay, hardly could hee finde a place in all his minde for himſelfe. This new gueſt thus lodged in <hi>Liſanders</hi> heart, counſelled him to ſee his Lady. Now this Knight was a moſt abſolute Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a moſt acceptable companion, eſpecially among Ladies, of a ſweet and courteous converſation, full of attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and recommended with ſo many excellent parts, as well of body as of minde, that it ſeemed Love had ſtollen into this man, of purpoſe (if it were poſſible) to ruine <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi>'s chaſtity: for there was appearance, that if ſhee could love any thing, it muſt needs be him, who loved nothing but her; and that if ſhe had not a heart of ſtone, ſhee muſt needs be apprehenſive of his torment. But for as much as hee could
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7258:4"/>
not well acquaint himſelfe with this woman without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſting the husband, he firſt ſought <hi>Cleanders</hi> friendſhip; who held it for an honour, and prevented his ſuit, recompencing <hi>Liſanders</hi> feigned, with true affection. He ſeldome ſpake but of him, nor ever made any good relation if <hi>Liſander</hi> were not the ſubject thereof. <hi>Caliſta</hi> her ſelfe, who ſaw not but by her husbands eyes, nor judged but by his knowledge, could not chooſe but honour that, which ſhee ſaw <hi>Cleander</hi> loved; ſhe being otherwiſe by <hi>Liſander</hi> adored with ſo much reſpect, that ſhe ſhould have wanted humanity, if ſhee had been with out diſcerning thereof.</p>
            <p>Behold here a faire beginning for our Lover; but this is nothing without perſeverance: His care was now to make knowne unto her the great paſſion which hee ſuffered for her, and to let her know it in ſuch a faſhion, that <hi>Cleander</hi> might not perceive it. Hee was cleare ſighted, like a Linx; and although he were not jealous, yet he was a husband, and unto a wife, whoſe admirable beauty did deſerve to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: If he once did diſcerne of this love, all was loſt, there could be no more friendſhip nor acquaintance; and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to reſolve to dye in a ſilent griefe, ſo neere unto his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, hiding his death from her who was the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hee could never conſent thereto. And indeed it is better never to ſee that which one loveth, than ſeeing it, not to dare to expreſſe ones love; for the object ſtirreth up the deſire: Neither is there any evill in the world like unto the preſence of a forbidden good. Which the Poets the better to expreſſe, did not repreſent <hi>Tantalus</hi> his thirſt in a Deſert void of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but in the middle of waters, not being able to drinke. To prevent then the husbands diſtruſt, and to keepe ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from entring into his minde, hee ruled his actions, his words and his lookes in ſuch ſort, that in his ſight hee never came neere unto the wife, hee never ſpake unto her, nor ever looked upon her, but as upon a thing indifferent: neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo free, nor too reſerved; fearing leſt if hee were too much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or not enough, hee might diſcover his deſigne in the guiding thereof. He held therefore a meane betweene both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with that dexterity, that there was no geſture nor motion of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7258:5"/>
his, which did not rather ſeeme naturall than affected. In the meane time, to make that knowne unto one, which hee would have inviſible unto the other; hee every day made matches with <hi>Cleander,</hi> and other Knights, of Tiltings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble Exerciſes: where the two friends were alwayes of a ſide, and alwayes vanquiſhers. In the morning they were together at the Church, after dinner together in their houſes, after ſupper in their gardens, and alwayes <hi>Caliſta</hi> is the ſtarre which lightneth the place. Time paſsing in this manner, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> conſumes, occaſion of ſpeaking unto his love being not offered: It is true, that every day he ſpake unto her, but not of love, nor of any thing reliſhing thereof; ſo that in every mans eye hee languiſhingly decayed, of an unknowne paſsion, in the midſt of all the contentments which could be imagined. And although hee intended to diſſemble his evill, covering his true griefe with feigned joy, yet did the dying colour of his face diſcover (yea, even unto thoſe of ſmall knowledg) that there was ſome paſsion in him, which with much griefe lay at his heart. <hi>Cleander</hi> is the onely man who doth not perceive it, beleeving that he ſhould wrong his friend in thinking ſo. Hee diſcerned plainely how the lively flowers of his face did daily wither, but he thinks that it proceeded from accident, and would have imagined that it ſprung from any other than from the true cauſe. They were then at the Court, in the great city of <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſo proudly raiſeth her head above all the Cities, almoſt of the world, when as <hi>Cleander</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanders</hi> indiſpoſition proceeded from the unwholeſome aire of the City; wherefore he was reſolved to lead him into the countrey. Now he had a houſe, a dayes journey from <hi>Paris,</hi> built in a Lake, within the middle of a great Parke called <hi>Beauplain:</hi> the ſituation whereof being pleaſant beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing, would have rejoiced ſorrow it ſelfe. Thither did he invite <hi>Liſander,</hi> together with three or foure friends, and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi> alſo, without whom the feaſt was of no value, went along with them.</p>
            <p>It was then in the Spring, when the earth, more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than at any other time of the yeare, reneweth her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and decketh herſelfe in her richeſt apparell. There
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7258:5"/>
               <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta,</hi> continuing unto <hi>Liſander</hi> their acuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med loving entertainment, made triall, that the country recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations which they gave him, together with all other honeſt delights, were no better remedies for his languiſhing, than the pleaſures of the city. The exerciſe of Hunting, which was ordinary with them, could not divert his fantaſie: vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of company, wherewith hee was every day viſited, did but increaſe his evill, and gave him occaſion to ſteale out of their companies, to entertaine himſelfe alone with his thoughts, which he durſt not communicate to any body li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. One day, they having made a match to hunt an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying Stagge, <hi>Calista</hi> having ſtayed at home with a young brother of <hi>Cleanders,</hi> called <hi>Berontus,</hi> after ſome time wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out with her brother in law to ſee their returne from the hunting: and as ſhe was at the ſide of a wood in the middle of the Parke, ſo thicke, that ſolitarineſſe perpetually reſides there, in the ſhadow of an impenetrable leafineſſe, ſhe heard a voice, which, in bewailing manner, proceeded from the bottome of this wood. In the beginning ſhe could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the complaint, but going ſomewhat neerer with <hi>Berontus,</hi> who onely conducted her, ſhe heard theſe words. Poore <hi>Lyſander,</hi> muſt thou conſume in theſe woods the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable remainder of thy youth, and unprofitably loſe thy life, both in abſence, and unknowne unto her who is the cauſe thereof? Muſt thou needs dye obſcurely, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the contentment to let her ſee in thy death, the ſacrifice which thou offereſt unto her of thy life? O faire <hi>Caliſta,</hi> is it poſsible that ſuch a divinity as yours, ſhould be ignorant of thoſe extreame affections which you ſtirre in me, and have no feeling of thoſe flames which you ſo lively kindle in my ſoule! Can it be that a cauſe ſo faire ſhould be ignorant of ſo neceſſary an effect as my love? O God, ſuffer not this want of knowledge in her, to be a puniſhment unto me, for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude unto <hi>Cleander.</hi> O <hi>Liſander,</hi> thou doſt violate, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the law of Hoſpitality, the moſt perfect friendſhip in the world: Neither canſt thou hope for pardon in any reſpect but onely in this, that thou art forced by a beauty which bendeth every thing under the violence of its ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7258:6"/>
and whoſe excellency not alone leſſeneth thy fault, but maketh thee worthy of pardon, and alſo of merit. By theſe words they knew not onely the ſubject of this complaint, which was love: but alſo the perſon that made it, who was <hi>Liſander</hi>; and her for whom it was made, who was <hi>Caliſta.</hi> It is not to be ſpoken, who was more abaſhed of <hi>Caliſta</hi> or <hi>Berontus</hi>: for this paſſion was equally unknowne to them both. But <hi>Caliſta</hi> was moſt aſhamed and moſt grieved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her innocency was ſufficiently witneſſed by this complaint. And indeed it was enough to have troubled a very able and wiſe woman; for ſhe did not know, whether ſhe ought to entreat her brother in law to hold his peace, or tell her husband, or whether ſhe were beſt to hide or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that, which might bee told by his brother, and where there was no leſſe danger to conceale it, than ſcandall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it: Nevertheleſſe diſſembling her thought, ſhee went on, as if ſhe had not heard any word of this diſcourſe. <hi>Beron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who was none of <hi>Liſanders</hi> beſtfriends, jealous of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch love which his brother did beare him, had a faire occaſion to divide them: but he, conſidering that hee ſhould wrong his ſiſter, and not willing to imbroile his brothers heart with ſo miſerable a paſſion as Jealouſie, nor to ruine the affection which he ought unto his wife, in deſtroying that which he unduly bare unto <hi>Liſander</hi>; reſolved in himſelfe to ſay nothing: But all theſe conſiderations were apart, and in ſilence, without communicating any word one unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the end <hi>Berontus,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Caliſta</hi> returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying a word, ſpake unto her in this manner: I doe not wonder, Siſter, at <hi>Liſanders</hi> languiſhing, but I rather wonder at your cruelty, who ſo ungratefully ſuffer a Knight of his merit to dye, without taking any care or knowledge of the wounds which your beauty giveth him. Brother, ſaid <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> you ſhew as much folly in entertaining me thus with his evill, as he doth in complaining, if it be true that he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten himſelfe ſo much; for I am unwilling to heare, either your diſcourſe, or his complaint. But becauſe we may have no more cauſe of ſuſpition thereof, and that the houſe may be as well free from ſuſpition as from crime, I doe conjure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7258:6"/>
you to remove away the cauſe, and to finde ſome meanes ſo to drive him away, that I may have no more cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the good which (you ſay) he wiſheth unto mee. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Berontus,</hi> it is a buſineſſe wherein I cannot ſerve you to my deſire, becauſe if hee ſhould complaine unto my Brother, and he be willing to know the occaſion, I muſt be conſtrained to utter that which were no way fit for him to know: but if you thinke well to write a Letter, ſuch as your diſcretion can deviſe, I will cauſe it to fall into his hands, as it were by chance, and by this meanes I beleeve, that honouring you as he doth, he will rather willingly baniſh himſelfe from your preſence, than trouble the peace both of your houſe and minde. <hi>Caliſta</hi> approved of the advice, and in this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (without being diſcovered by <hi>Liſander</hi>) they went to the houſe, whither alſo <hi>Cleander</hi> inſtantly returned with a fat Stagge, accompanied with thoſe who had hunted with him. Shortly after came <hi>Liſander,</hi> who did not know that his complaints had ſounded ſo neer unto his Miſtreſſes eares, and leſſe did he thinke that <hi>Berontus</hi> had heard them. They ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped joyfully together, <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta</hi> diſcreetly diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the divers thoughts wherewith their mindes were troubled; and when bed-time came, <hi>Cleander, Berontus,</hi> and almoſt all the company, brought <hi>Liſander</hi> unto his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where, after ſome few words of courteſie, they left him alone with his ſervants. He, going to the cupboord to take ſome of his night-cloaths, found upon his Cap a Letter to this purpoſe.</p>

            <p>If <hi>Caliſta</hi> were ſurpriſed with <hi>Liſanders</hi> complaint, he was much more aſtoniſhed at <hi>Calista</hi>'s Letter, which <hi>Berontus</hi> (in going laſt out of the chamber) had privily let fall upon the table. He could not imagine who had written, or who had brought it: well hee knew, that the complaints which had eſcaped from him in the wood, were heard, and from thence came the knowledge of his moſt ſecret thoughts. O what newes were theſe to bring reſt unto a man oppreſt with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous paſſions! All night hee did nothing but muſe who ſhould give him this advice: That it was <hi>Cleander,</hi> there was no appearance, becauſe hee had beene all day a hunting, and after his returne hee did not leave his company; neither was it likely that he would have proceeded in this manner. Hee could not alſo imagine that it was <hi>Caliſta,</hi> becauſe that he did not know that ſhee had walked abroad with <hi>Berontus.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Letter expreſſely ſaid, that neither ſhee nor <hi>Cleander</hi> knew of it: And that it ſhould be <hi>Berontus,</hi> hee had already found that he did not love him; neither did he thinke, if this young man had had ſuch an occaſion againſt him, that hee would have uſed it ſo diſcreetly. To be ſhort, he knew not to whom to returne anſwer: nevertheleſſe hee reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his departure, and upon the meanes whereby hee might make <hi>Cleander</hi> like well of it, as alſo to ſpeake particularly to <hi>Calista.</hi> The day appearing, he quickly diſpatched one of his Footmen to Fountaine <hi>Bleau</hi> (where the King then was) commanding him to carry ſome Letters, which hee had written unto his friends, and with all ſpeed to bring him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The footman departed with all diligence, and returned the next day with Letters from his friends; who ſent him word, that he muſt make ſpeed unto the Court, out of ſome important reaſons, which they could not write. During the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7258:7"/>
abſence of his man, hee endevoured by all meanes to accoſt <hi>Caliſta;</hi> which he could not effect poſſibly: for ſhe prevented him with ſo much care, and with ſuch premeditated avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that he judged ſhe had knowledge of his deſigne, and that from thence came the Letter which had given him ſo much paine, ſeeing that before nothing was more eaſie than his acceſſe unto her. When his man was returned from the Court, hee went unto <hi>Cleander,</hi> who was then alone in his chamber with his wife; and having communicated his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto him, he entreated him not to take it amiſſe, if he did deprive himſelfe of the happineſſe which hee enjoyed in his company, for a ſmall time, which he did aſſure him, ſhould bee as little a while as hee could, yet would it nevertheleſſe ſeeme long unto him, in regard of the contentment and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he received in his ſo deare converſation. <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was very ſorrie that hee muſt loſe the preſence of his friend, and ſaid unto him; Yet ſhall it not be ſo haſtily, but that I will importune you to give this day unto mee; for I have ſome buſineſſe at the Court, which I will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate unto you, if you bee not preſſed with your owne. Now, as we ſaid <hi>Cleander</hi> had many other friends with him, whom (according to his courteſie) willing to entertain, he left <hi>Caliſta</hi> alone in the chamber with <hi>Liſander,</hi> as if hee had contributed unto his deſires. <hi>Liſander</hi> ſeeing himſelfe alone with her, ſaid, that hee had communicated newes unto <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> which he had received from the Court; but he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the deereſt perſon in the world, which he could not utter but unto her alone, entreating her to ſee them in this little Letter, whoſe ſhortneſſe was ſuch, that ſhee could not have the leiſure to bee troubled with the reading. And in ſaying this he preſented her the Letter, which ſhe her ſelfe had written. <hi>Calista</hi> knowing it, and not being able to keep her countenance (inflamed with indignation and ſhame) from confeſſing that ſhee had done it, anſwered him in this manner: Silence or flight were much profitabler for you <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> than either your diſcourſe or ſtay here. Content your ſelfe that I have not acquainted <hi>Cleander</hi> with the wrong which you procure both unto him and unto mee, and that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7258:8"/>
ſuch a one knowes it, as doth onely forbeare to tell him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would not hazzard my honour, with the loſſe of your life. Madam, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> then hee cannot but ſay, that I love <hi>Cleander</hi> with as perfect an affection as hee doth me, and that I doe adore you with as much reſpect and devotion as can be yeelded unto Divinity it ſelfe; which is farre from endevouring to wrong either the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is true Madam, that if the advantage which the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of love have over thoſe of friendſhip, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your beauty (which is as impoſſible to bee beheld without being beloved, as it is to come neer the fire without feeling the heat thereof) have made mee dare to diſcover it unto trees in the depth of the Forreſt; the violence of my love muſt be accuſed, which hath conſtrained me, and your excellent beauty from whence it hath ſprung: And let the worſt be, Madam, I cannot be accuſed for any thing, but for loving the moſt lovely creature in the world. And if this be the crime which you ſpeake of, I confeſſe not alone that I have committed it, but, which is more, that I cannot repent me of it. As for my life, Madam, with the loſſe whereof you threaten mee; as I will not keepe it but for your ſervice, ſo I cannot better loſe it than for your love. I would (if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God) that I had many, and that nothing letted but their loſſe, to witneſſe my affection: But ſeeing that you are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and that I cannot hazzard it, but with your reputation, and in depriving you of the moſt faithfull ſlave that ever you captivated; I had rather barre my ſelfe from the Soveraigne bliſſe of my ſoule, than take from you the leaſt contentment. And for this cauſe, Madam, I am reſolved not to depart from your ſervice for ever, but for ſome time from your preſence, to the end, that adoring you without offending you, I may witneſſe no leſſe affection than obedience, and that both of them may one day invite your pity, to call backe a poore Exile, who hath baniſhed himſelfe from the deareſt abode that ever he had, to obey you.</p>
            <p>Theſe words, ſpoken with no leſſe love than grace, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the inevitable charmes of <hi>Liſanders</hi> converſation, which would have inchanted even rockes, touched the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7258:8"/>
places of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s affection, which were not marble, nor of any inſenſible matter, yet ſuch, as with a chaſte reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhee beatbacke all thoſe ſhafts, which Love, hid in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanders</hi> eyes, did continually ſhoot at her heart: wherefore ſhee thus anſwered. <hi>Liſander,</hi> you muſt know <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and beleeve, that if ſhe could give her ſelfe unto any one, it ſhould be unto you; but ſhee cannot doe but what ſhe ought: and if you doe love her truely, as you doe profeſſe, you ought not to hope nor deſire any thing, but the will with which ſhee doth acknowledge alwayes the affection which you beare her; and were not her honour intereſt, ſhe would hold your preſence as deare as your merit doth oblige her: But for this time I counſell you to follow the reſolution of departing, which you have already taken, becauſe that <hi>Berontus,</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with me when we heard your complaint, and having learned more than I would that he knew, may do you ſome evill offices to <hi>Cleander.</hi> And although hee ſhould ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet we know not what hee may thinke: he is jealous enough of the love which his brother beares you, and may grow as jealous of me, although I doe not thinke I ſhall give him cauſe. Hereafter bee more diſcreet in your complaints, and thinke, that though woods cannot ſpeake, yet they are not without their Ecchoes, which reſide in their centers, and doe alwayes report (at the leaſt the laſt word) what they heare. Upon the uttering of theſe laſt words, <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> came into the chamber, which not onely interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their diſcourſe, but alſo put both of them in great doubt that <hi>Berontus</hi> had conferred with his brother about that whereof they were ſpeaking: but this diſquiet laſted not long, becauſe that <hi>Cleander</hi> taking <hi>Liſander</hi> apart, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing to him his buſineſſe at Court, let him preſently know, that he knew nothing of theirs; and <hi>Berontus</hi> (in the meane time) ſpeaking with <hi>Calista,</hi> ſhe told him what ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the ſcroule had, which was let fall into <hi>Liſanders</hi> hands, which occaſioned the leave he had taken of <hi>Cleander</hi> and of her ſelfe, although under a pretext of Letters which were come unto him from Fountaine <hi>Bleau</hi>: concealing nevertheleſſe from <hi>Berontus</hi> that <hi>Liſander</hi> had ſpoken unto
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7258:9"/>
her of it, or made any demonſtration that he knew or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſhe had written it.</p>
            <p>This done, they went to dinner, and afterwards <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> got to Horſe; having firſt kindly embraced <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Berontus,</hi> and more lovingly kiſſed the faire <hi>Calista,</hi> who could not ſee him depart without ſorrow, although ſmall in reſpect of that which hee carried with him. All the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie remained ſad for his departure, except <hi>Berontus,</hi> who was not otherwiſe an enemy of his vertue, but envious: for he being a brave Gentleman, &amp; hardy as the ſword, thought hee loſt of his luſtre, when he was compared to <hi>Liſanders</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable valour; who riding as faſt as hee could ſpurre, without ſtaying all the reſt of the day, came upon the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the evening into the entrance of the Forreſt of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Bleau.</hi> The knowledge which (eſpecially in France) is ſo frequent of this royall houſe (the proudeſt I thinke, in the world) ſhall keepe mee from beautifying this my Story with the deſcription thereof, although it were one of the moſt glorious ornaments wherewith I could enrich it. It ſhall ſuffice onely to ſay, that our Kings have heretofore built it for the pleaſure of hunting, in the middle of the Launds and Forreſts, from whence it was called the Deſerts of Fountaine <hi>Bleau. Liſander</hi> then entring into this Forreſt, onely with one man on horſebacke, who waited upon him in his chamber, and two Footmen which ranne by him, had not ridden a hundred paces, when he was told by the repor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of ſeven or eight Harquebuſhes, and Piſtoll-ſhot, and the cryes of many perſons, that there was fighting neere him. He preſently ſpurred his luſty Horſe that hee had under him, which carried him ſuddenly into the middle of tenne or twelve Theeves, who were murdering of a brave Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, having laid two of his men upon the ground, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered three or foure others, who had accompanied him: He nevertheleſſe defended himſelfe valiantly with his Sword, having already diſcharged his Piſtoll upon one of the Theeves, wherewith hee lay biting the ground with the Gentlemans two men. <hi>Liſander</hi> ſeeing how bravely this Gentleman acquitted himſelfe, moved with his owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7258:9"/>
courage, let flye his Piſtoll, and almoſt in an inſtant thruſt himſelfe amongſt the rout with his ſword and his Horſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of which had his effect; the Piſtoll laid one along, with his Horſe hee overthrew a ſecond, and with his ſword he killed a third, and all in ſo ſhort a ſpace, that one muſt have had a quicke diſcerning, who had not judged it to be one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: His Sword hee had not long uſed, before the ground was ſtrawed with blood, and diſmembred parts of the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who were ſooner killed and vanquiſhed than they could almoſt thinke that any ſuccour was comn unto the Gentleman; who alſo ſaw himſelfe delivered, before hee could thinke of helpe. <hi>Liſander</hi> after this bloody execution comming neere unto him, ſaw that hee was a reverent old man, having his head and beard all white; of whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded how he did after his combat? Well, anſwered he, I thanke God, and your good help, unto whom I am redueable for my life: but I am grieved for my men, who are either all loſt or dead. For thoſe which are dead (anſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>) there is no calling of them againe, but for the reſt, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be loſt ſo neere the Court, whither I thinke you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is true, ſaid the old Gentleman, that I am going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not to make any ſtay; for it is long ſince my age and the contentment of a free life, which I have accuſtomed my ſelfe unto at home, have exempted me from that honourable ſervitude. But leaving this diſcourſe unto another time, I would faine ſee if among thoſe which lye for dead, there is none of mine yet alive: Saying this, he alighted, and <hi>Liſander</hi> alſo, whoſe men by this time were comn unto them, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them of this labour. They looking amongſt them who lay upon the ground, found two of the old mans ſervants ſtill breathing, although wounded in many parts of their bodies, as well with ſhot as with ſwords: They called the other with lowd cryes, which ſounding through the Forreſt, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the ſilence of the night, and ſolitarineſſe of the place, came unto thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this Knight, than he himſelfe was joyfull for the recovery of his ſervants; the two firſt which were found wounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead, were Gentlemen (as ſuch had rather dye at their Maſters feet, than ſave their lives by ſhamefull flying) whom he cauſed to be lifted upon their horſes, ſetting the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers behinde to hold them up, and ſo they proceeded in their journy toward Fountain <hi>Bleau.</hi> By the way, which was a good league and more, <hi>Liſander</hi> intreated this Knight to pardon his curioſitie, if it did ſtretch ſo farre, as to deſire to know the cauſe of this accident; at leaſt, if this his requeſt might not ſeeme too much importunitie. The old man, looking <hi>Liſander</hi> ſtedfaſtly in the face, as much as the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night would give him leave, and thinking him the braveſt and beſt faſhioned Gentleman that ever bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, anſwered him in this manner: Not alone of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, whereof I cannot tell you the cauſe, but alſo of all my life (which you have ſaved, obliging mee thereby to hold it, next after God, of your Sword) I will give you ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that although I cannot ſatisfie my obligation, I will ſatisfie (at leaſt) your curioſity.</p>

               </gap>es, and few memorable actions have beene in my time in Chriſtendome, wherein I have not had the honour to bee. I followed the fortune of <hi>Monſier du Mayne,</hi> in that famous battell of Lepantho, where <hi>Don John</hi> of Auſtrige, and the Venetians made the Eaſterne Sea looke redde with the Turkiſh blood. A long time after I was with old <hi>Monſier de Guiſe,</hi> in that fearefull battell of Anneau, when with a handfull of Volentiers hee defeated many thouſands of Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which were come from Roane unto the bankes of Loiere. Afterwards I was with the late <hi>Monſier de Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> when hee made that great and never-enough celebrated retraict of Caviſe, where he retired many leagues in Hungary before a hundred thouſand horſe, with an army of fifteene thouſand men. Finally, willing to retire my ſelfe, I married a wife in mine own country, whole name is <hi>Otranta,</hi> who hath borne unto me a ſonne, whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7258:10"/>
daughter who is called <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and not long ſince married to a Knight of this countrey called <hi>Cleander.</hi> It is now eight dayes ſince I departed from my houſe and my wife, out of a deſire which I had to ſee my children; one of whom I have ſeene but once ſince his comming out of Italy: Now he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the King; and the other lives about a dayes journey hence, with the Knight her husband, whom even now I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. This afternoone I departed from Paris, where I have ſtayed theſe three dayes, and as I came from thence on this ſide of Auſſone, the theeves ſet upon me, they having follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me untill I came into this wood, where I had met with my grave, if you had not happily ſuccoured me. Thus brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you have what I can ſay of my fortune, and my life. But gentle Knight (if it pleaſe you) I pray tell mee your name, that I may know unto whom I may give thankes for my preſervation; for it is unreaſonable that I ſhould not know him, unto whom of all men in the world I am moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; nor that you ſhould refuſe this courteſie unto him, unto whom you have not refuſed to expoſe your life for the ſafety of his. Sir, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> I am a poore Souldier, ſo little knowne in the world, that though I ſhould tell you my name, you would never the better know my perſon: yet thus much I will ſay, that I am come out of thoſe parts, whither you are going, and doe know by good intelligence, that thoſe whom you goe to ſee, are in good health: And I have heard ſo much good of their merits and vertues, that I account the ſmall ſervice which I have done you, exceeding well employed, although the onely conſideration and fame which I have heard publiſhed of your valour (whereof you have made large proofe in this encounter) doth oblige mee to render you more ſignall offices, which, with time, I hope to performe: And then, Sir, I will not onely declare unto you my being, but I will let you ſee that I am in no leſſe degree of love unto you, than one of your children.</p>
            <p>By this meanes <hi>Liſander</hi> did thinke that hee ſhould have avoyded the telling of his name unto good <hi>Dorilas,</hi> who did intreat him with a paſſion ſo great, as the refuſall of ſo juſt a demand did augment his deſire. But one of his footmen (in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7258:11"/>
the meane time) holding ſpeech with one of <hi>Dorilaſſes,</hi> and not knowing that his Maſter had a deſigne to hide his name, did nakedly tell, without thinking, whatſoever his Maſter did endevour to diſſemble: yet becauſe they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what their Maſters ſaid, nor their Maſters what they ſaid, it came not at this time to the old mans knowledge. Shortly after they came unto Fountaine <hi>Bleau;</hi> but it was late, and the Court being very great, they could get but two chambers in one houſe, which <hi>Liſander</hi> left unto <hi>Dorilas</hi> and unto his people, going himſelfe with his ſervants unto a friends lodging of his, to <hi>Dorilas</hi> his great griefe, who did much deſire that they might accommodate themſelves in one lodging. Let us leave him among his wounded ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom he cauſeth to bee dreſſed with great diligence, and no leſſe danger of their lives: and returne wee unto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> who retiring of himſelfe (as we have ſaid) to one of his friends called <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> he was received with all loving entertainment. At ſupper he told the adventure which had happened to him in the wood, the encounter which <hi>Dorilas</hi> had with the theeves, the ſuccour which hee gave him; in briefe, the relation which <hi>Dorilas</hi> had made of his fortune. And when hee named <hi>Lidian, Clarangeus</hi> demanded if hee knew him. I have never ſeene him, ſaid <hi>Liſander,</hi> but I have heard that he is one of the braveſt Gentlemen in the world. One of the braveſt you ſhall ſee, ſaid <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> and one of the gentleſt: wee have both done our exerciſe in <hi>Benjamins</hi> Schoole, whom you know to be one of the vertuouſeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen living of his condition. After that, wee travelled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into Italy, and there have alwayes lived familiarly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And ſince our returne, I never met with any man who hath more obliged mee to make account of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but I thinke when things are come to their perfection, they cannot continue, returning unto the eſtate wherein they were at firſt. I ſpeake this, becauſe of late we have not lived as we were wont, and all for the love of a perſon, who in my opinion gives neither of us thankes; and I doe beleeve, that if one of us doe not ſhortly alter his courſe, we ſhall not ſeeke one another long. I ſhould be ſorry it ſhould ſo happen, ſaid
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7258:11"/>
               <hi>Liſander,</hi> for the good which I wiſh unto you, and in reſpect of what I have heard of him; and it were better that you ſhould yeeld your difference to your firſt friendſhip, rather than let it paſſe any further. This cannot be, ſaid <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> becauſe wee both looke upon one object; neither are wee men to yeeld that whereunto wee have a deſire. If hee had beene embarked before mee, my love ſhould have given place unto his friendſhip; but being firſt in time, and not leſſe in merit, I cannot doe it in affection. I told him yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day what I thought, before my Miſtreſſe: neither doe I know what he thought, but I have ſeene the time when hee would have underſtood me. Now this <hi>Clarangeus</hi> was one of the moſt accompliſhed Gentlemen of the Court, and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> and he were both ſuiters unto one Lady, whoſe fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections we will hide under the name of <hi>Olinda,</hi> and about this occaſion had ſome little quarrell that very day; whereat <hi>Liſander</hi> was much grieved, ſeeing himſelfe comn juſt upon the debate of two friends, the bloudy lawes whereof, in the French honour, obliged him to ſerve the one or the other of them. And indeed the next morning earely, hardly were they awaked, when a Gentleman, knocking at their lodging doore, asked to ſpeak with <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> who (being called up into an outer chamber, and ſeeing him making of himſelfe ready) told him that he was come from <hi>Lidian,</hi> who deſired to ſee him in the fields with his ſword; which well he could not tell him yeſterday, becauſe he was not willing to offend the reſpect of a perſon, whom he adored above all creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that having taken upon him this charge, he had obliged him to receive him into his company, to ſerve him to ſome other purpoſe than as a meſſenger; wherefore he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat that he would make choice of ſuch a friend, who might ſerve him in the quality wherein hee ſerved <hi>Lidian. Claran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geus,</hi> without ſtay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> trouble, or alteration, anſwered in this manner; You cannot be more welcome: I am ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your friend in the field, as I would have done in his houſe, if he had ſent mee word. For a Second, I have none, neither will I have any (if it pleaſe you) for I know you to be ſo brave and ſo honeſt a Gentleman, that I will go among

Sir, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who was the bringer of to challenge, and a very valiant Gentleman, you anſwer as well becomes you, and as I my ſelfe ſhould do if I were in your place; but you know that ſometimes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is of more force than duty, and that I ſhould bee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bring you two to fight, and in the meane time I my ſelfe have mine arms in a ſcarfe.

That may very well be, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Liſander</hi>; but may not I alſo ſee her? No ſir, ſaid <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangeus</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kings and Lovers will have no companions. Sir, ſaid <hi>Alcidon</hi> unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> you are not a man to bee refuſed, if <hi>Clarangeus</hi> will beleeve mee, and if you are willing, it ſhall be your fault if ſhe be not ſhewed you. There ſhall bee no fault in me, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> and to witneſſe unto you that I have a deſire thereunto, I doe now tell you I doe already know your meſſage, and that if <hi>Clarangeus</hi> refuſeth the offer which you make in the behalfe of your friend, I will accept of it betweene you and mee. <hi>Alcidon</hi> anſwered, then are we as I would deſire; and now I hope <hi>Clarangeus</hi> cannot refuſe to give <hi>Lidian</hi> contentment, ſeeing that with his will or without it, we ſhall try it together. Well, anſwered <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangeus,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:7258:12"/>
let mee then ſee <hi>Lidian,</hi> and doe you accommodate your ſelfe (to your deſire) with <hi>Liſander,</hi> although there is no reaſon, that having no quarrell one with another, you ſhould ſo raſhly precipitate your ſelves upon your owne armes. <hi>Liſander</hi> did never undertake a quarrell with more griefe; not that he did doubt <hi>Alcidon,</hi> or that he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſerve <hi>Clarangeus</hi>; but hee did conſider the diſpleaſure which he ſhould doe unto <hi>Dorilas,</hi> whom hee had ſo freſhly obliged; unto <hi>Cleander,</hi> who loved him ſo dearly, and, which was more than the reſt, unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> in aſſiſting a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her brother: but the French paſſion (which in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is beaſtly, and conſtraineth thoſe who doe deteſt this pernicious cuſtome, to obſerve it, and to embrace a falſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in ſtead of a true) made him paſſe over all thoſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. Thus went they towards their combat: <hi>Alcidon</hi> brings them into a meadow, where <hi>Lidian</hi> ſtayed for them upon a good horſe, with a ſword by his ſide: there, having all alighted, and put themſelves into their ſhirts, <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Liſander</hi> left <hi>Lidian</hi> with <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> and went apart about a hundred paces, where being ready prepared, they ran one at the other, and at the firſt encounter were both wounded; <hi>Liſander</hi> gave him a very great wound in his thigh, which he ran thorow, and he himſelfe was wounded in the left arme, ſo that the one loſt the uſe of his thigh, and the other of his arme: But <hi>Alcidon</hi> fell downe, unto whom <hi>Liſander</hi> ſaid, We fight but for our friends, and for our honour, without any particular occaſion of hatred to each other, wherefore you having ſome of my bloud, ſuffer me, I pray, though unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, to carry away this of yours, and that remaining your friend, I may goe ſeparate thoſe whom a ſmall occaſion hath made enemies. This being ſaid, without ſtaying for anſwer, hee ran unto <hi>Lidian</hi> and <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> whoſe combat had proceeded in this manner; <hi>Lidian</hi> had made a thruſt unto <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> which lighted upon his Rapier, and going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the barres of the hilts, wounded him in his right hand, but he himſelfe was wounded in the left hand, and his Sword, engaged in the hilts of his adverſaris, broke in the middle: Then ſeeing <hi>Liſander</hi> comming towards him with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7258:13"/>
his ſword naked and bloody, and not ſeeing <hi>Alcidon,</hi> he did verily thinke that he had killed him, and came now to helpe his friend; wherefore ſeeing two ſuch enemies upon his hands at once, and himſelfe without a ſword (for whom two had beene too little) that he was in extremity, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be imagined: yet diſſembling his thought, and willing to cover his preſſing and manifeſt danger, as one who had rather loſe a thouſand lives, than one title of honour; he caſt which way hee might revenge his death, which hee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to bee inevitable, when <hi>Liſander</hi> threw himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their weapons, and before <hi>Clarangeus</hi> could have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeake one word, he cryed unto them, Sirs, you are both noble, both bloody, and both friends, without having any advantage one of the other, or if there be any, it is rather due unto fortune than valour, which is equall between you; I conjure you to give your difference (which is but ſmall) unto your ancient friendſhip which was ſo great, and unto this blood, which <hi>Alcidon</hi> and I have ſhed for your pleaſure. How, ſaid <hi>Clarangeus</hi>? and ſhall not <hi>Lidian</hi> confeſſe himſelfe vanquiſhed, being alone, and without a ſword, againſt us two? Never vanquiſhed though killed, anſwered <hi>Lidian;</hi> for although you kill mee, yet I will never want courage to dye, though I want armes to defend my ſelfe. Live then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, ſaid <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> for it ſhall never bee ſaid that I tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over you rather by fortune than vertue. Ah, ſaid <hi>Lidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> now thou haſt vanquiſhed me, in ſaying I ſhould remain invincible, my life being in thy hand, which thou haſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſpared, when I would not have begged it to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed it from death. In ſaying this, he flung away the reſt of his ſword, and ran to embrace ſometimes <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Liſander</hi> (having teares in their eyes out of tender joy, principally <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> who was more particularly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with his former affection) equally thanking them for their courteſie. In the meane time <hi>Liſander</hi> loſt much blood, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> more, whereby hee was not able to riſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all three went unto the place where he fell, and found him more afflicted with griefe that hee could not follow <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> than with his wound; but when he knew the happy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7258:13"/>
ſucceſſe of their combat, his contentment made him forget the greater part of his griefe.</p>
            <p>Now this challenge could not be carried ſo ſecretly, but <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda,</hi> who was the cauſe of it, knew alſo the effect; by whoſe fearefull, yet loving minde, it was quickly divulged through the Court, and many of the chiefe Courtiers were on horſe-backe to hinder the combate betweene ſuch noble Gentlemen: but inaſmuch as no man knew the place which was choſen, they ſo long rode up and downe the fields to ſeeke them, that the blowes were all paſt, and they had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their people, who were binding of their wounds to ſtay the blood, when they came in unto them: The firſt who found them were of <hi>Alcidons</hi> friends, who cauſed him to be laid upon a hand-litter, and carried unto Fountaine <hi>Bleau. Lidian</hi> having taken his leave of him, and left in charge with them, he accompanied <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Clarangeus</hi> to the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the Launds, and there againe renewing the oath of his former friendſhip, and contracting a new affection with <hi>Liſander,</hi> he tooke leave of them, who ridde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Paris, he himſelfe directing his courſe to <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> to ſee his brother <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and his faire ſiſter <hi>Caliſta.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilſt <hi>Lidian</hi> endevoured by hard riding to reach <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> the newes of his combate ſpread through all the Court, ſo that <hi>Dorilas</hi> his father waking in the morning, and ſending one of his men to the Caſtle to enquire for his ſonne, about eight of the clocke he underſtood by him, that his ſon was gone very early to fight, that there were three more in the company, and that all the Court was on horſe-backe to part them: which newes did ſo much trouble him, that hee was likely to ſtrike him who told it; yet ſpeedily reſolving, hee got to his horſe, and galloping after thoſe which were gone before, it was not long ere he met with thoſe who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Alcidon,</hi> from whom hee learnt the ſucceſſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and the retreat of the Combatants. Whereupon the good old man returning to Fountaine <hi>Bleau,</hi> recommended the care of his wounded Servants to the Surgeon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſetting his foot in the ſtirrop, in great haſte rode unto <hi>Beauplaine</hi>; and as there is no better ſpur, or rather no better wings than thoſe of love, ſo the affection which hee bare his ſonne, carryed him ſo nimbly, that <hi>Lidian</hi> was in <hi>Cleanders</hi> armes embracing, when <hi>Dorilas</hi> came, ſo that it ſeemed they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7258:15"/>
came together. It is not to be told whether <hi>Caliſta</hi> were more glad, or <hi>Lidian</hi> more ſurpriſed at the unexpected comming of their father.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Dorilas</hi> had embraced <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> did him reverence, whom <hi>Dorilas</hi> embraced as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and diſſembled for the preſent any knowledge of his affaires, although he ſaw his arme in a ſcarfe: but a ſmall time after ſitting at Supper, and <hi>Lidian</hi> not uſing his left hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the faire <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſitting neere him, invited him to bee merry, ſaying, I thought at the firſt, brother, that you wore this faire ſcarfe for faſhion ſake, but now ſeeing you doe not uſe your hand, I thinke it is out of neceſſity. It is true ſiſter, anſwered <hi>Lidian,</hi> neither doe I know how it happens, I have ſuch a fluxe fallen into my arme within theſe few dayes, that I have loſt the uſe thereof. I know well, anſwered <hi>Dorilas,</hi> from whence it proceeds; but to eaſe me of the labour of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, relate it your ſelfe, and lye not, otherwiſe I ſhall make another quarrell betweene you and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> if you contrary the truth which hee told mee. <hi>Lidian</hi> finding himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by ſuch a teſtimony, and that hee could no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe a thing ſo viſible, related from point to point the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell which hee had with <hi>Clarangeus</hi> (as you have heard) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the great friendſhip which had been betweene them, untill their love unto <hi>Olinda,</hi> for whoſe ſake only (being jealous one of the other) they had fought, being never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by any injurious words: the Challenge delivered by <hi>Alcidon</hi> to <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> with whom <hi>Liſander</hi> caſually being, offered himſelfe to be a Second; finally, hee told them how <hi>Liſander</hi> (having wounded and overthrowne <hi>Alcidon</hi>) parted <hi>Clarangeus</hi> and him, when they were both wounded, and when his owne ſword being broken, he made a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to have had them both upon him; exalting the valour and courteſie of his enemies, but principally <hi>Liſanders,</hi> who he ſaid was author both of his ſafety and life, with ſo many words of praiſes and commendations, that <hi>Cleander</hi> could not expreſſe, nor <hi>Caliſta</hi> diſſemble their contentment.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Lidian</hi> had finiſhed his diſcourſe, <hi>Dorilas</hi> began in this manner: You, ſonne, for your pleaſure have runne a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7258:15"/>
dangerous fortune, but that which happened to me was no leſſe, neither was there above a night betweene in time, nor above a league in place: for yeſterday, going from Paris to Fountaine <hi>Bleau,</hi> and comming late into the wood, I was ſet upon by tenne or twelve theeves, who wounded almoſt to death two Gentlemen, whom I have left at Fountaine <hi>Bleau,</hi> and put two or three other of my people to their heeles, that without helpe (in my opinion) more than humane, which came to mee when I was reſolved for death, I had not now beene alive. Then did hee tell them how he was ſuccoured by the valour of one man, who comming in miraculouſly, either killed or put to flight all the theeves: further, ſaid hee, I never ſaw him but by night, yet me thought hee had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and figure of an Angell; neither in all my life did I ſee any thing more courteous, or more humble: nevertheleſſe he did me this diſpleaſure to conceale his name, although his refuſall was accompanied with the faireſt and gentleſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes that could bee; telling further, that hee came from theſe parts, and that he underſtood by good intelligence, you were both in good health. Sir, ſaid a ſervant of <hi>Dorilaſſes,</hi> who ſtood waiting behinde his chaire, hee who ſuccoured you in the wood, was called <hi>Liſander,</hi> for his man told mee ſo, and alſo that he came from hence: yet when he heard his Maſter conceale his name, he entreated me not to ſpeake of it; and I doe verily beleeve that hee is the very ſame who this day fought with <hi>Alcidon,</hi> for it was ſaid this morning at Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Bleau</hi> (in ſpeaking of this quarrell) that one of them came but late laſt night to the towne. You have reaſon, ſaid <hi>Cleander,</hi> for yeſterday after dinner hee went from hence, and he might well reach the wood about the houre you ſpeake of. By this ſecond newes <hi>Liſanders</hi> praiſes were augmented, and every one ſpake of his vertues, &amp; of thoſe ſervices which he had done in the perſons of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s parents: who could have beene ſo ungratefull, as not to acknowledge the merit and fidelity of ſo perfect a lover? Let us now confeſſe that vertue hath no prevailing enemies; and as the beauty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, producing admirable affections, juſtified the honeſt love which <hi>Caliſta</hi> afterwards bare him, ſo had it juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7258:16"/>
her of an unexcuſable ingratitude, if ſhee had not loved him. Now the nature of envie being moſt to fight and bite againſt vertues, when they are moſt commended, the more <hi>Liſanders</hi> lovely qualities were commended, the more was <hi>Berontus</hi> his courage incenſed againſt him: for hee having heard the complaint, walking with <hi>Caliſta,</hi> which <hi>Liſander</hi> made in the wood, and thereby knowing that all his ſervices had no reſpect but unto her, was juſtly ſpighted to ſee aſwell his brother, as all the reſt take them to their advantage; which <hi>Caliſta</hi> diſcreetly marked, gathering <hi>Liſanders</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations with ſo much modeſty, that her coldneſſe did not diſcover any diſſimulation, nor her liberty, affection. Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes did <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Lidian</hi> ſtay at <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Clarangeus</hi> at Paris, during which time both their wounds were healed; but that which <hi>Caliſta</hi> had made in <hi>Liſanders</hi> heart, grew every day worſe, neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nor diverſion, nor company, nor buſineſſe, proving apt remedies for his healing: which made him almoſt reſolve once againe to appeare before his onely remedy, if the divers obſtacles which concurred had not retained him. For hee knew that <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Lidian</hi> were both there, and <hi>Berontus</hi> alſo, whoſe preſence was more dangerous than all of them; and what hope could hee have to entertaine her opportunely with any ſpeeches, amongſt ſo many watchfull eies? He was not willing to loſe <hi>Cleander</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and above all things be feared to offend <hi>Caliſta</hi>: wherefore hee reſolved before the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of two ſuch freſh obligations ſhould ſlippe out of her memory, to write unto her, to know whether he might ever hope for time or place, when, without diſturbance, hee might ſee the onely object for which hee cheriſhed his ſight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having called one of his Footmen, an old ſervant whom hee had long knowne to be faithfull, commanded him to goe unto ſuch a Village neere <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> where hee ſhould finde ſuch a woman, unto whom he ſhould give this Letter, and wait for an anſwer in her houſe, but upon his life he ſhould take care that he were not ſeene; and for that cauſe hee ſhould not come thither before it was night, and ſhould goe away before day. Now <hi>Liſander</hi> had long before pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed

                  <p>MAdam, if you knew how my heart beateth, and my hand trembleth, now when my Love commandeth me to ſend you this, you would have leſſe apprehenſion at the ſight hereof, than I have feare in the writing, and more pity of my paſſion, than I have courage to expreſſe it. It is a wonder, Madam, to ſee me ſuffer ſo much, and that I can live ſo long in ſo rigorous an abſence: but it muſt bee referred to your beauty, through the which the moſt impoſſible things are eaſie unto mee. I will not relate the torment which I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, the evils are contagious, and that which I could ſay, may peradventure cauſe griefe in you; ſuffer onely that I entreat you to ſave my life in preſerving your honour, which you cannot well refuſe to your very enemy, and which you may yeeld unto me in giving me the meanes to ſee you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcandalizing or injuring of any man. I doe alſo intreat you to beleeve, that my life is not ſo deare unto mee, that I would preſerve it with the leaſt prejudice unto you; and if I ſhould ſorrow for the loſſe thereof, it would bee rather in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of you than my ſelfe, and out of the griefe I ſhould have

to ſee my end before I had teſtified the beginning of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. To conclude, Madam, all theſe words are too weake to witneſſe ſo ſtrong an affection as mine, and doe rather leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen than expreſſe it; therefore I intreat you not to judge it by their weake eloquence, but by your owne perfections, who are the faire cauſe; and beleeve that there is not any kinde of ſervice which I could not eaſilier yeeld than offer. I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſentence of my life or death in your anſwer, and will remaine ſo perfectly yours, that I cannot ſay any thing neare to it, when I ſay I am your moſt faithfull, moſt obedient, and moſt affectionate ſervant.</p>

               <hi>Caliſta</hi> having read this Letter, and being no leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with the obligation which ſhee had unto <hi>Liſanders</hi> love, than with the duty unto her owne honour, and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> love, diſcourſed long in her ſelfe, whether ſhee ought to anſwer; her honour repreſenting, that an honeſt, wiſe, vertuous woman, as ſhe would bee accounted, and as ſhee was, ought not to doe any thing in ſecret ftom her husband, much leſſe give him any anſwer, and already did her heart reproach her with the audience which ſhee had given him, and made her alone in her Cloſet bluſh with ſhame for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it: But Love pleading <hi>Liſanders</hi> cauſe, and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his admirable qualities, his incomparable affection, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified with ſuch ſignall and late ſervices, accuſed her for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering (with no leſſe cruelty than ingratitude) a life to bee loſt which ought to bee ſo deare unto her, if not for the love which ſhee bare him, at leaſt in that hee had ſaved both her fathers and her brothers; and the rather, becauſe ſhee might preſerve it by a word, or by a looke, which would oblige <hi>Liſander,</hi> without any way offending <hi>Cleander.</hi> Following then this laſt opinion, and knowing that <hi>Dorilas</hi> was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take <hi>Cleander, Berontus,</hi> and <hi>Lidian</hi> along with him the next day, ſhe concluded not alone to write backe againe unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> but to take this occaſion to ſee him in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, without any bodies privity; yet with this reſolution, not to yeeld him any favour but only ſight and ſpeech: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe anſwered thus.</p>

                  <p>I Have received your letter againſt my will, and anſwere now againſt my duty, which is to advertiſe you of yours, and to have you forbeare any further ſuit, in a matter which cannot chuſe but be dangerous unto you, and not to promiſe to your ſelfe from mee any more than ſuch good will as my honour and your vertue may make you hope. You are not now to begin to doe me ſervices, which you offer me, for you have already performed them, and ſo binding, in the perſons moſt neere unto me, that I cannot chuſe but bee ſorry at the griefe which you ſuffer by my meanes, and by your abſence; but I doe beleeve, you love me with ſo much honour, and are ſo perfect a friend unto him, whom I onely can love, that you would not that I ſhould remedy it to his prejudice; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if you would, were it availeable, ſeeing it is impoſſible: yet foraſmuch as you onely demand to ſee me, and that thoſe obſtacles, which you your ſelfe have raiſed, doe hinder mee from permitting it openly, I had rather run a fortune in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way unto your deſire, than refuſe you ſo ſmall a mattter as my fight. To the end then that you may know, if I do not yeeld all that which I owe unto your merit, it proceedeth not from ingratitude, but from a former obligation, which hindereth mee from ſatisfying that which I am indebted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; I doe advertiſe you, that (if this letter may come to your hands this day) I hope to bee here alone to morrow: you ſhall find the little gate of the Garden open, and <hi>Clarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> not farre from thence, who ſhall attend you: Be there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eleven of the clocke, and ſee if I doe not hazzard more in this aſsignement, than you do in keeping it.

            <p>It is true <hi>Caliſta,</hi> you hazzard more in this than he, for hee could but loſe his life, and you both life and honour: neither doe I thinke it will be long before you repent it, although you are not guilty of any offence, either in effect or will.</p>
            <p>But not to digreſſe, this letter cloſed, and given unto <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> that ſhe might, as from her, give it unto the woman of the Village, to ſend unto <hi>Liſander, Caliſta</hi> went into the Hall,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7258:18"/>
where dinner was ready, and the company onely ſtaying for her, which ſhe excuſed as well as ſhe could. After dinner <hi>Cleander</hi> would needs give <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Lidian</hi> the ſport of hunting of a Stagge, whereupon they went all together a hunting, neere unto the Village where this woman dwelt, who was <hi>Liſanders</hi> meſſenger. It fortuned whileſt they were going to their ſport, a moſt violent ſtorm of raine fell ſo vehemently upon them, that they were conſtrained to ſeeke ſhelter; and finding none neerer than this womans houſe, (who, as I ſaid, was ordinarily at <hi>Beauplain</hi>) they ran thither (ſo faſt as their horſes would go) all together, and ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Liſanders</hi> Lacquey (who was within waiting for his diſpatch) could not hide himſelfe from being found and knowne by <hi>Cleander, Berontus,</hi> and <hi>Lidian,</hi> who asked newes of his Maſter. The footman, who was not prepared for this ſurprize, remained ſo aſtoniſhed, that he wiſhed himſelfe dead: nevertheleſſe making a vertue of neceſſity, and not being able to hide his amazement, hee diſguiſed the ſubject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> telling them, that hee was not now with his Maſter, who had put him away for a ſlight occaſion, when after ſo many faithfull ſervices which he had done him, hee ought to have expected a recompence; ſo that not knowing what to doe, and not having the heart to ſerve any other man, he reſolved to come to <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> to entreat their favour to write in his behalfe unto <hi>Liſander</hi> to take him againe, ſeeing the cauſe for which he had put him away, was onely for giving a boxe on the eare unto a fellow of his, who had not ſerved him above three dayes, whereas he had ſerved him ſixe yeeres; But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſtorme falling, hee had come thither as well for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as alſo to entreat the woman of the houſe (who had well knowne him at <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> and had beene well acquainted with ſome friends of his) to write unto his Maſter in his behalfe. Truly, ſaid <hi>Cleander,</hi> if it bee no other matter, I will write in thy behalfe ſo ſoone as wee returne from hunting: come and lye at <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> and I will give thee a Letter.

Behold the perils into which thoſe expoſe themſelves, who, to attaine their ends by any meanes whatſoever, put their lives and honours into the hands of ſuch perſons: Yet ſhe ſeeing their cheerefull countenances, and the Footman comming towards her before them all, as if hee had not yet ſeene her, ſhe recovered the ſpirit and judgment, which ſhe had before loſt, and aſcribing her troubleſome countenance to the foule weather, which beat with violence in her face, ſhee made a low reverence unto all the company. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, ſaid <hi>Cleander</hi> we have ſurprized your houſe, which hath done us good ſervice againſt the rain; and having found here <hi>Liſanders</hi> Footman, who ſtayed for you, we have vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his behalfe unto his Maſter. How (ſaid ſhee) Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, have you forſaken your Maſter? It is hee Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, anſwered the Footman, who hath put me away, and <hi>Cleander</hi> here (I thanke him) hath entreated him by a Letter to take mee againe, being alſo come unto you to entreat you (in reſpect of your ancient knowledge of my friends, and your acquaintance with my Maſter) to doe the like for me. Truely, ſaid ſhe, where his recommendations have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I am aſſured mine will not be availeable: nevertheleſſe, becauſe you ſhall not thinke that I ſay this in excuſe, I will write unto him. Shortly after the raine ceaſing, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being cleere, <hi>Dorilas</hi> and his company left the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman with <hi>Liſanders</hi> Footman, under colour of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the time of hunting being paſt, they returned all to <hi>Beauplaine</hi>; where they ſupped as hungerly as if they had ſpent the time in hunting. In their ſupping, they (diſcourſing from one thing to another) began to ſpeake of <hi>Liſanders</hi> Footman; which gave a warme alarum unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who (as all thoſe who finde themſelves guilty) thought that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word ſpoken would have tended unto the diſcovery of her fault, untill by the end of their ſpeech, ſhe found that they knew nothing of her affaires. The Footman having told the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7258:19"/>
woman all that had paſt betweene thoſe Gentlemen and him at their meeting, and receiving <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s letter, returnes in extreme haſt to his Maſter, whom hee almoſt put into a fever by the recitall of this accident, and having given him aſwell <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s letter as <hi>Cleanders,</hi> hee reſolved to ride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, without any company but the ſame footman, who alſo ridde; and ſo they two together tooke their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> from whence the very ſame day <hi>Cleander,</hi> together with <hi>Berontus,</hi> departed to accompany <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Lidian</hi> to Fountaine <hi>Bleau</hi>: but the good old man would not ſuffer them at any hand to ride farre, but made them (though unwillingly) returne backe; ſo that his returne being more ſpeedy than <hi>Caliſta</hi> expected, much perplexed her: yet ſhee wiſely diſſembled it by a fained joy, which ſeemed true; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her light ſupper did manifeſt unto <hi>Cleander,</hi> that ſome thing did trouble her, and ſhee her ſelfe confeſſed ſhe was not well, but he judged it to be onely ſorrow for <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Lidians</hi> departure. This indiſpoſition of health did apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve to colour her ſudden retyring to her chamber, which ſhortly after ſupper (<hi>Clarinda</hi> alone being with her) bidding the reſt of the company good night, ſhee did; and <hi>Cleander</hi> alſo (who was ſomewhat weary) did the like into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and all the reſt by their example. The night was darke, and all the houſe in ſilence, when <hi>Clarinda</hi> going ſoftly out of her Miſtreſſes chamber, went unto the garden gate, where <hi>Liſander</hi> was appointed to be, who, becauſe hee would not faile his appointed time, had almoſt killed his horſes to get thither: Having found him with his faithfull footman, ſhe tooke him by the hand, and without being perceived by any body, ſhee brought him (to his unſpeakeable joy) to <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s bedde ſide, where ſhee then was lying. When hee ſaw this incomparable beauty (which hee could not religiouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough adore) waite him within her bedde with ſo many graces, he was about (looſing that reſpect which hee did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomably beare her) to forget the condition upon which hee was permitted to ſee her: But <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who had no leſſe ſeverity to make him feare, than ſweetneſſe to make him love, ſtayed this motion of his, and with one word made
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7258:20"/>
him ſit downe in a chaire by her bed ſide: unto whom ſhee began to ſpeake in this manner; <hi>Liſander,</hi> if you knew the paine and danger which I hazzard to content your deſire, you would love me more for this alone, than for the beauty which you ſay is in me, Know that <hi>Cleander</hi> is not at Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Bleau,</hi> as both he and I did thinke he ſhould; for my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not ſuffer him by any meanes to goe farre with him, but forced him (though againſt his will) to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſo that now he is retired into his owne chamber, to let mee reſt with more quiet here alone, becauſe to keepe my word with you, I made him beleeve that I was ſicke, chuſing rather this night to breake company with him, than my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with you. <hi>Caliſta</hi> had ſcarcely uttered theſe words, when they heard knocking at the doore, and <hi>Liſander</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was <hi>Cleander</hi> (as it was indeed) did beleeve that <hi>Caliſta</hi> had ſet this match to undoe him; the very firſt newes, that a man, whom he thought ſo far off, ſhould be ſo neere, having raiſed this doubt in his minde: But when hee heard the knocking at the doore, there was no diſcourſe of reaſon ſtrong enough to divert him from thinking that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed; wherefore he ſaid to <hi>Caliſta,</hi> Madam, you had many other meanes to deſtroy my life, but I perceive you doe deſire it ſhould be together with <hi>Cleanders.</hi> No, ſaid ſhe, in taking him by the hand, I take heaven to witneſſe (I have now neither meanes nor leiſure to make other proteſtation) wherefore I pray let that, together with the proofe which you ſhall ſee, ſatisfie you. I doe conjure you by all that may be deare unto you, to ſtand cloſe behind this Tapeſtry: ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this ſoftly as ſhe could, ſhe asked aloud oftentimes, who was there? and called <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who being fitted for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, mad ſhew as if ſhe were aſleepe. In the end, <hi>Liſander</hi> being placed betweene two pieces of the Hangings by the bedde ſide where ſhe was, and holding with one hand both the pieces cloſe together, but onely for a little hole through which he might ſee who came, and to put the noſe of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll, which he had ready in his other hand; <hi>Clarinda,</hi> ſeeming halfe aſleepe, and being but halfe ready, went to open the doore unto her Maſter, who going round about his wives
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7258:20"/>
bedde, ſhut cloſe with a curtaine but upon one ſide, came ſo neere unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> that he touched the end of the Piſtoll. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> hath many times ſince related this, and I have heard him often ſay, that this was the greateſt feare that ever his heart was capable of; although that ſeeing <hi>Cleander</hi> come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in his night-gowne and night-cap, he knew <hi>Caliſta</hi> had not betraied him, as he did beleeve. <hi>Cleander</hi> then comming unto his wife, asked her how ſhe did? ſhe anſwered that her fever had encreaſed ſince ſupper, for want of ſleepe, and that ſhe did beleeve her recovery did conſiſt in reſt. <hi>Cleander</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the hand, and finding her pulſe beat violently, as it could not chooſe in that her apprehenſion, told her never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe that it was nothing, and that he was alſo much more perplexed: but my trouble proceeded from another cauſe; for I dreamed even now that I had loſt you, and that there was a Dragon here, which would carry you away: ſo that waking in this feare, and remembring that you went ſicke to bedde, interpreting my owne dreame, I feared that your ſickeneſſe was the Dragon, which I ſaw carrying you away: And this is the cauſe of my comming at this time, to ſee how you doe; but God bee thanked you are not ſo ill as by my dreame I thought you were, for which I am glad. I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lye down by you a while, to feele the courſe of your pulſe, and then I will let you reſt. When <hi>Liſander</hi> heard <hi>Cleanders</hi> dreame, he did verily beleeve that he was diſcovered, untill he heard the expoſition which was made: and <hi>Caliſta</hi> her ſelfe knew not what to thinke; who ſeeing <hi>Cleander</hi> reſolved to ſtay, bid <hi>Clarinda</hi> draw the curtaine cloſe, becauſe the light of the candle did trouble her eyes. <hi>Clarinda</hi> going to obey her Lady, was conſtrained to let goe a little dogge which came in with <hi>Cleander,</hi> which ſhe had held in her armes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bedde, fearing that hee would winde <hi>Liſander.</hi> The little dogge was no ſooner out of her armes, when running towards the bedde ſide, it preſently (ſmelling that there was a ſtranger) began to barke ſo eagerly and ſo loud, that <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> would have riſen (ſeeing that <hi>Clarinda</hi> could not catch it) from off the bedde to drive him away: and had done it, if <hi>Caliſta</hi> had not lovingly withheld him. In the end the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7258:21"/>
dogge was taken and put out of the doores, becauſe hee was as importunate as faithfull: and <hi>Cleander</hi> having ſtayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an houre with his wife, went his way, ſuffering (by his abſence) <hi>Liſander</hi> to take a little breath, who during his ſtay had beene vexed with ſo many warme alarums. The one was no ſooner gone out of the chamber, but the other came out of his hiding place, and kneeling downe before <hi>Caliſta,</hi> demanded pardon of her for his miſtruſt, proceeding from ſuch apparent likelihood; unto whom (lifting him up with her hand) ſhee ſaid, Hereafter <hi>Liſander</hi> learne to know <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> and beleeve that her ſoule ſhall never be ſpotted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liſander</hi> beginning to grow warme by the touch of her hand, although it were cold as ſnow, and forgetting the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger paſt, by the ſight of her preſent beauty, anſwereth her with ſo amorous a kiſſe, that he thought his mouth ought to be knit unto <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s, and his ſoule to be gathered-in at her lips; neither would hee willingly have beene drawne from ſo agreeable a trance. Soft <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Caliſta,</hi> I promiſed you nothing but ſight, neither did I thinke to have permitted any further than ſpeech: content your ſelfe with the danger wherein I have throwne my ſelfe, and the wrong which I have done unto my duty, to acquit my promiſe unto you, and conſtraine mee not to withdraw the love which I now beare you, through your indiſcretion, as I have now pulled you to mee under the aſſured reſpect which I did promiſe my ſelfe from your modeſty. Madam, replyed <hi>Liſander,</hi> I doe humbly crave pardon, if I ſhew my ſelfe unwilling to loſe ſo faire an occaſion of enjoying ſo many wonders; for I ſhould dye out of griefe, and give you juſt cauſe to laugh at my ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: my paſſion is ſtronger than my ſelfe, and my vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is the more excuſable, proceeding from your wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beauty, which forceth mee now to conſtraine you to have pity upon me; And in ſaying this, he invaded earneſtly his Miſtreſſes Dominions, endevouring to raviſh away the laſt favour, for which hee had put himſelfe into this haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; when with an extreme anger, and a loud and ſhriller voice than the danger wherein both of them were, would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7258:21"/>
well permit, ſhe called her Gentlewoman, and ſaid unto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> Is this the recompence of the danger whereinto I have caſt my ſelfe to oblige you? Well, bee gone preſently if you would not that I ſhould ſhew <hi>Cleander</hi> the true Dragon, which hee ſaw but in his dreame: Thereupon <hi>Clarinda</hi> riſing up of one ſide, and <hi>Liſander</hi> forbearing of the other, <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s voice was a little quieted, but not her heart, what words or ſubmiſſions ſoever <hi>Liſander</hi> ſaid or did, who was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to goe away with this biting ſorrow, that hee had loſt the favour of his Miſtreſſe with too much importunity. Was not this well rid, well waited, well ſuffered, and well frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to buy with the price of ſo many feares ſo bleeding a griefe? I doe wonder that hee did not preſently kill himſelfe before her, at leaſt to worke horrour and feare in her, ſeeing he could not ſtirre pity: but he did better in doing nothing, but going away fuller of ſorrow than of life, lighted onely by <hi>Clarinda</hi> unto the doore, who durſt goe no further, fearing leſt hee might bee diſcovered; ſo that hee being in the dark, grabling his way, with one hand upon the raile of the ſtaires, and a Piſtoll ready bent in the other, as hee was againſt <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> chamber doore, which was ſomewhat lower than <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s, his feet ſlipt from him, ſo that hee fell down the ſtaires, even to the bottome, and beſides the noiſe which hee made in falling, the Piſtoll which hee had in his hand went off, and gave ſuch a report, that it awaked all the houſe. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Berontus,</hi> and as many as were in the houſe roſe in a fright, and began to cry out all together, asking one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what was the matter, others calling for light. <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who was not aſleepe, nor any way diſpoſed thereunto, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her husband and brother-in-law cry, and not knowing whether <hi>Liſander</hi> had ſhot his Piſtoll againſt them, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had taken him, was in more than a deadly agonie. <hi>Clarinda</hi> fearing to be diſcovered and puniſhed, deſparately cryed out, All was in diſorder and confuſion. <hi>Liſander</hi> being at the foot of the ſtaires, more amazed than hurt, and more hurt than ſeene, his Piſtoll being fallen out of his hand, and his hat from his head, and fearing to bee diſcovered if hee

But not to raiſe more ſorrow in you than the relation of the truth will bring with it, I will returne to our amorous <hi>Liſander,</hi> diſgraced not alone by fortune, but (which was moſt inſupportable to him) by his Miſtreſſe, gallopping towards Paris, whilſt <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> having gotten lights, viſited all the houſe to finde what it might be, that had ſo unexpectedly troubled their deepe, but quiet ſleep: but although they ſearched both high and low, within and without, the queſt ended with no more knowledge than it began: and not being able to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the true cauſe of this Alarum, they judged that ſome theeves would have robbed them: For confirmation of which, ſome of the ſervants, who with eyes hardly awake had ſeene a glance of <hi>Liſanders</hi> running by, for one whom they had not well ſeene, they ſaid that they had ſeene ſixe, and there was one, who to ſeeme more valiantly fortunate, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them that the Piſtoll was ſhot at him, and that the bullet came whiſtling ſo neere his eares, that it blew and ſhaked

his haire. Thus <hi>Liſanders</hi> eſcape paſſed for an attempt of robbers in <hi>Cleanders</hi> opinion, who failed not to goe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s chamber, to tell her that the noiſe was made by theeves that were fledde, wherefore hee wiſhed her to take her reſt this morning (for the day did begin to break) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence her nights unquiet reſt. Truly he had reaſon, for ſhee had but ſmall; yet this laſt comming was much more welcome unto her than the firſt.

He ſhewed them the Kitchin door, where (he thought) the Piſtoll was ſhot at his man: hee ſhewed alſo the Garden gate, where (as hee ſaid) they came in and went out; leaving all the company, either in deed, or in ſhew, wondering at the accident: finally, after ſo tedious a diſcourſe to the two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, they altered the ſubject of their ſpeech, of which though there were divers opinions, yet none thought the truth. For three or foure dayes while they ſtayed at <hi>Beauplaine, Liſander</hi> uſed all his endevour to ſpeake with <hi>Calista,</hi> and ſhee, all that ſhe could to avoid him, unleſſe it were in company. <hi>Liſander</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:7258:23"/>
ſeeing himſelfe barred of that meanes, had recourſe unto <hi>Clarinda,</hi> and unto the woman who had delivered his firſt letter: both of them excuſed themſelves, upon <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe forbidding, not alone to ſpeake for him, but alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver any letter for him. When hee ſaw all his inſtruments faile him, he reſolved againe to baniſh himſelfe from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Miſtreſſe, and to goe into ſome place where hee might at leaſt eaſe himſelfe by complaint. Holland, which was then the ſeat of the warre, and is at this day the Schoole thereof, by the valour and capacity of that brave Earle, who hath better underſtood it, and better made it than can be ſaid, furniſhed him with a brave occaſion: The Archduke threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to attach <hi>Reyne Berk</hi> with a ſiege, and the States prepared themſelves to defend it. Of the one ſide was the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola,</hi> Generall of his Highneſſes army, who by his exploits againſt Oſtend and Sluſe, had gotten immortall renowne with the Spaniards and Walloones, who without bragging may be called good Souldiers, and who doe beſt obſerve the diſcipline of warre of any nation of the world; and among all other, the brave Count <hi>Bucoy,</hi> and our French <hi>Terraile.</hi> Of the other ſide was the valorous Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> of whom we ſpake even now, under whoſe name alone, in one word, may be comprehended all warlike vertue, accompanied with his young brother, who doth nobly imitate him, as the moſt perfect example which hee can follow; with a brave army, but not ſo ſtrong as the enemy, compoſed for the moſt part of French and Engliſh, two of the warlikeſt nations this day, or which ever have beene upon the earth: over whom ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (like two great ſtarres in a cleare night) the dead <hi>Bethune,</hi> and the brave <hi>Caſtillion</hi>: The firſt dying with the reputation of knowing better the art of warre, than any man of France; and the other (having had a grandfather, an uncle, a father, and a brother, who, in theſe our dayes, have filled the world with the knowledge and admiration of their valour) liveth this day in eſtimation, worthy of their memory. <hi>Liſander</hi> propounding theſe reaſons unto <hi>Cleander,</hi> the better to build lawfull excuſes of his departure, made them appeare ſo juſt and honourable unto him, that in ſtead of diverting him, hee

There were all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which might ſerve either for or againſt this voyage,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7258:24"/>
brought and debated betweene them: and although <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s teares were more plentifull than his diſcourſe, yet they gave place unto his will, and conſented to that which they could not hinder. It was therefore determined, that during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhe ſhould go unto <hi>Bellaire</hi> to <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Otranta,</hi> who paſſionately deſired to ſee her; he further aſſuring her, that ſhe ſhould hardly bee returned home before hee were come backe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleander</hi> having brought his wife unto this reſolution, two daies after he took leave of her, to go unto <hi>Paris</hi> to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date him there of ſuch things as were moſt neceſſary for his voiage; again were their teares renewed at ſo pitifull a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Liſander</hi> had much adoe to containe, having his heart ſo pierced with anguiſh, that he could not utter one word.

A ſtrange felicity of a man, and more worthy to bee envied for the joy he felt, that he had ſo obliged her whom he loved, not onely in the perſon of her father &amp; her brother, but in her husband alſo, than for the glory which he received: for although hee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7258:25"/>
were then publikely honoured of all, and after the ſiege high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended by Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> and admired of all the States; yet the occaſion which Fortune lent him to ſerve his Miſtreſſe, and to acknowledge <hi>Cleanders</hi> love, vvas more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed than the honour for which he had ſo nobly hazzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his life. Novv as the skill of beſieging places in theſe our dayes, and rather in that countrey than any place of the vvorld, is come to ſuch perfection, that there is no towne vvhich is impregnable: <hi>Reyne Berk</hi> having held out three moneths againſt the attempts of the beſiegers, rather by the valour of the beſieged, than by the ſtrength thereof, yeelded upon compoſition. The States having paid <hi>Berontus</hi> his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Clarangeus</hi> being healed of their wounds, our Warriours covered vvith Lawrell returned into France. <hi>Calista</hi> in the meane time, having ſtayed three or foure dayes after her husbands departure at <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> left the houſe in the guard of a keeper, and taking an old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with her, whom <hi>Cleander</hi> had left to attend her, and two maids, with <hi>Clarinda,</hi> earely in a morning entred into her Coach towards Paris, with purpoſe to goe from thence into Normandy to ſee her parents. <hi>Auſſun</hi> is a village where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have ſpoken before, which lyeth in the mid-way, not alone betweene <hi>Beauplaine</hi> and Paris, but betweene Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Bleau</hi> alſo and Paris, and therefore well known and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by all thoſe eſpecially who follow the Court. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi> comming unto this towne about dinner time, ſaw a Caroch ſtanding at the doore of the Inne, and going into the houſe, a Lady perfectly faire, who came from Fountaine <hi>Bleau,</hi> and was going to Paris. At firſt they did not know each other, but ſaluting, <hi>Caliſta</hi> knew that it was <hi>Olinda</hi> her brothers Miſtreſſe, and <hi>Olinda</hi> knew her alſo to bee the faire <hi>Caliſta, Lidians</hi> ſiſter. Their complements quickly gave place to the admiration which they had each of others beauty, and to the ceremonies which are uſually among women: but their dinner being over, Time, which they were to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, called on them to depart; and being to go all one way, the more commodiouſly to entertaine one the other, <hi>Olinda</hi> entred into <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s Caroch, leaving her owne for the other
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7258:25"/>
Gentlewomen and maids. There ſhe underſtood the cauſe of her journey, how ſhe went to viſite her parents, to ſee if the contentment which ſhee hoped to receive by their ſight, might wipe away the ſorrow of her husbands abſence. <hi>Olin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> (who knew not that they were gone into Holland) with the pleaſure which ſhe received to heare that <hi>Lidian</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangeus</hi> were gone together good friends, felt no leſſe ſorrow for <hi>Lidians</hi> abſence, than <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſuffered in her heart for <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Liſanders.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, as they gave not place one unto the other in affection, ſo they did not yeeld one unto the other in skill how to diſſemble it: for <hi>Olinda</hi> had alwaies loved <hi>Lidian,</hi> yet ſo diſcreetly hid it, that hee himſelfe could not diſcerne it; and from thence proceeded the quarrell which hee had with <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> becauſe that thinking ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the other better than ſhe did him, and <hi>Clarangeus</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as much of <hi>Lidian,</hi> they grew jealous one of the other. Now (according to a naturall deſire of holding ſpeech of that which one loves) they almoſt ſpoke of no other thing all their journy; and being come unto Paris, they parted, with aſſured promiſes of perpetuall friendſhip. <hi>Caliſta</hi> promiſed to be backe againe at Paris within a moneth, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thence untill <hi>Cleanders</hi> returne, which ſhee hoped would be ſhortly after, and to write to her in her abſence. Thus <hi>Olinda</hi> remained at Paris, and <hi>Caliſta</hi> three dayes after arrived at <hi>Bellaire,</hi> who was received there with the tendreſt and deareſt affections that could be expreſſed: They deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded newes of <hi>Cleander,</hi> and ſhe told them how <hi>Liſander</hi> and the other whom we have named, were gone to <hi>Reyne Berk,</hi> according unto the deſigne which <hi>Liſander</hi> had propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. God ſend them a happy returne, ſaid the old man; for next unto my children, whom naturall affection maketh me preferre before all others, nothing can bee ſo deare unto mee as this <hi>Liſander,</hi> who you ſay is the author of this journey; He ſaved my life once, and gave it me the ſecond time in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Lidians</hi> your brother. I doe not thinke that two ſuch obligations can ever be perfectly acknowledged. <hi>Calista</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied not, becauſe ſhe would not diſcover what ſhe thought; but falling into other ſpeeches, told them, how upon the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7258:26"/>
way ſhee met with <hi>Olinda,</hi> whom ſhe no leſſe wiſhed to bee her ſiſter-in-law, than <hi>Lidian</hi> did to bee her husband <hi>Dorilas</hi> himſelfe knowing the quality of her perſon, and her great eſtate (a conſideration which at this day, eſpecially with old men, doth extraordinarily worke) would alſo have beene glad to have beene her father-in-law. A moneth after <hi>Caliſta</hi> came unto <hi>Bellaire,</hi> newes came of <hi>Berontus</hi> his taking priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of <hi>Alcidons</hi> and <hi>Clarangeus</hi> being wounded, and of the extreme danger wherein <hi>Lidian</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> were; which had beene to their utter loſſe, if <hi>Liſanders</hi> incomparable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue had not freed them. This newes came like an unreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blow, to imprint deepe in <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s heart, already made flexible by his former ſervices, his incomparable qualities, and matchleſſe perſon, as alſo his moſt religious affection unto her, which wrought no leſſe effect than any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being that alone for which ſhee entred into the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the one, and did preſume was the cauſe of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieving the reſt; yet wiſely diſſembling whatſoever was in her heart, it appeared not in her eyes, but with ſilence paſt it over, untill in the end <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Otranta</hi> breaking out, cried, O God, wilt thou never be pleaſed to bleſſe us ſo much, that we may be able to acknowledge theſe unſpeakable favours, for which we are ſo much indebted unto this Knight? Some comfor it would bee if wee might but ſee him. Daughter, ſaid <hi>Otranta</hi> unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> you ſhall not goe from hence before <hi>Cleanders</hi> returne; and if hee will have you, he ſhall come himſelfe for you, that wee may ſee this <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſo good an Angell unto us. Theſe words did wonderfully pleaſe <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> unto whom now it was a paine to diſſemble the love which ſhe bare him; and who (conſidering the ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this love, the meanes by which Fortune did neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conſtraine her to acknowledge them, otherwayes tyed in the ſame neceſſity unto that, which ſhee owed unto <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and unto her owne honour) could have wiſhed <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> leſſe accompliſhed, that ſhee might not be ſo taken in his love: Yet though ſhee found her ſelfe conſumed with the ſame fire which devoured him, ſhe reſolved rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it with her life, than to eaſe her ſelfe by any meanes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7258:26"/>
which might wound her honour. Thus having ſpent a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth longer at <hi>Bellaire</hi> than ſhee made account, and deſiring that <hi>Cleander</hi> ſhould finde her at <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> or at the leaſt at Paris, where ſhe had promiſed <hi>Olinda</hi> to be a moneth ſooner, they tooke leave of her with teares in their eyes: ſhee alſo (contributing hers unto their griefe, which ſeized them as violently at their departure, as her comming rejoiced them) went away accompanied with the ſame ſorrow which ſhee had left. They would have ſtayed her, if the old Gentleman who came with her, had not told them that <hi>Cleander</hi> had a buſineſſe in court, which did require the preſence of his wife: Away then ſhe went unto Paris, where the Court then was, and where ſhe employed a moneth more, aſwell in ſoliciting her husbands affaires, as in viſiting her friends; amongſt whom <hi>Olinda</hi> was not forgotten, neither was ſhe by <hi>Olinda</hi>: Their friendſhip was confirmed by this converſation, ſo much the more agreeable unto <hi>Olinda,</hi> by how much ſhee ſeemed to be with <hi>Lidian</hi> when ſhe was with <hi>Calista.</hi> They were lodged neere unto the Arcenall, where almoſt every day there was tilting, ſithence the returne of the Court (for the royall tilting place was not then finiſhed.) One after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone as they were all together, they were told that there were ſtrange Knights, who were come in the morning, and had challenged the Knights of the Court to breake ſome ſtaves with ſharpe points in open field, and that the King himſelfe about foure of the clocke would be there in perſon, thinking that they were Engliſh, who preſerve, in this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, the ancient reputation of the Knights of the round Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The novelty hereof (for it was not uſuall to ſee any tilting but with blunt ſtaves, and moſt commonly againſt Quintan) made our Ladies goe to ſee it, as alſo almoſt all the Court, ſome to have part of the danger and honour, ſome onely the pleaſure. But it continued not long, for one of the brave Knights of the Court, a great favourite of the King, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cloridon,</hi> running firſt againſt one of the ſtrangers, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne from his horſe, and wounded not onely with the ſharpe ſteele, but alſo with a ſplinter of the ſtaffe. And although the blow was not mortall, his Majeſtie neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7258:27"/>
was ſo ſorrowfull, that he cauſed the tilting to ceaſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſo ſoone as it was begun, intreating the ſtrangers to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves; who pulling off their Helmets to doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence unto him, were knowne to bee Frenchmen, and thoſe who about three moneths ſince went from <hi>Beauplaine</hi> with <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Liſander,</hi> who was the man that had ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: theſe men comming from Holland, had agreed to make their entrance into Paris in this manner. The King glad to ſee them, more eaſily bearing that <hi>Cloridon</hi> ſhould bee overthrowne by Frenchmen than by ſtrangers, as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve at the firſt, joyfully embraced them, and after hee had from them learned ſome particularities of <hi>Reyne Berke,</hi> and witneſſed by the honour hee did them how well hee was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with their actions, returned to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> leaving them amongſt the Ladies. <hi>Cleander</hi> finding out his <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who ſhined among the faire ones, as the bright Moon doth among the Starres in a cleere night, went unto her, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Argire,</hi> no leſſe joyfull for his return, than for <hi>Liſanders</hi> honourable atchievement; who heaped up ſo many proofes of his valour one upon another, that the laſt made the firſt forgotten. This <hi>Argire</hi> whom wee here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was a faire Lady, who among many ſlaves unto her beauty, had captivated <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who was not long before hee came unto her. <hi>Lidian</hi> alſo and <hi>Clarangeus</hi> tooke either of them <hi>Olinda</hi> by the arme, who remembring the bloody quarrell which they for her ſake had had betweene them, was in great care to content them both with ſuch indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that they might have no cauſe to be jealous: and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> with <hi>Liſander</hi> ſaluting <hi>Caliſta,</hi> in kiſſing her, ſaid in her eare, Friend, make much of this Knight; for without him your brother and I had not beene here now. Sir, anſwered <hi>Caliſta,</hi> this is not the firſt time that he hath obliged us, and that his good offices have exceeded all meanes of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement: But yet although hee hath taken from us the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, the will at the leaſt ſhall remain with us, which is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left unto us, to pay thoſe unvaluable courteſies. Madam, replyed <hi>Liſander,</hi> the ſervices which I have done you, are ſmal in reſpect of thoſe which I, together with all the world, doe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7258:27"/>
owe unto your merit; and I thinke you doe reproach me for their ſmalneſſe, when you ſpeake of their greatneſſe, and that ſo highly honouring ſuch poore actions, you would make mee bluſh out of ſhame that I have done them. Many other diſcourſes paſt betweene them, which I omit, deſiring rather to relate matter than words. They retired all together unto <hi>Cleanders</hi> houſe, where <hi>Caliſta</hi> prevailed with <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire</hi> to ſtay ſupper, beſides whom, they were viſited with many other Ladies, and <hi>Monſieurs</hi> of the Court. After ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Liſander, Alcidon, Lidian</hi> and <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> leaving <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> to entertaine thoſe which came in, retired themſelves to the Ladies, who were apart, and entertained them with extraordinary diſcourſes, becauſe <hi>Liſander</hi> could not ſpeake particularly to <hi>Caliſta</hi> before the company, nor <hi>Alcidon</hi> to <hi>Argire,</hi> and leſſe could <hi>Lidian</hi> ſpeake unto <hi>Olinda,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> who gathered all their words, and beſides the paſsions of love, felt alſo thoſe of jealouſie; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Olinda</hi> ſpake to neither of them (as little as ſhee could, that ſhee might not offend) but addreſſed her ſpeech unto the brave <hi>Liſander,</hi> who ſpeaking but little, and that (God knowes) farre from his heart, ſtood as if he were there onely to judge of others diſcourſe: And you brave Sir, ſaid ſhe, will you be alwayes as free as you are invincible? Can it bee that ſo much valour can be altogether unaccompanied with love? Wee are all unhappy, and ought to account little of our beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that we are not able to give one wound to your minde. <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta</hi> had much adoe to forbeare bluſhing at theſe words; And <hi>Argire,</hi> ſeeing that he anſwered not, ſpake unto <hi>Olinda</hi>: Thinke you, Madam, that ſeeing that greateſt courages are moſt ſubject unto this paſsion, that his can bee free? For my part, I doe not thinke him leſſe amorous than others, but I thinke him more diſcreet; and I beleeve his flame is ſo much the more violent, by how much he deſireth to hide it. Truely ſhe had reaſon, and failed not: but who would not have thought, that ſhe had diſcovered the ſecret of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s affection? who hearing her love thus diſcourſed by perſons who knew nothing thereof, could not well tell what to judge of it. In the meane time <hi>Liſander</hi> calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7258:28"/>
from the deepe ſilence wherein hee ſtood, as if hee were loſt in it, anſwered both of them in this manner; Since that <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe was not able to reſiſt love, in a time when hee had not thoſe armes which you give him, there is no great appearance that I ſhould be able to vanquiſh him now, hee being armed with thoſe unavoidable arrowes of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But alas, why ſhould I ſay that I am vanquiſhed? what would it availe mee to complaine of an evill, whereof I can hope for no remedy? What doe you know, anſwered <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire</hi>? it may be, ſaid ſhe, you ſigh ſecretly for one, who would be very glad that your complaints made knowne might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her to give you that remedy which you deſire. All the company laughed at <hi>Argires</hi> anſwer. And <hi>Caliſta,</hi> to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the pleaſure, fearing leſt her too much reſervedneſſe might raiſe a ſuſpicion that ſhe was intereſt in the diſcourſe; followed in this manner: If I knew this proud one, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaveth ſo much glory in captivating you, and that I were perſwaded my prayers would have eaſier acceſſe unto her than your merits, I would never forbeare importuning of her, untill ſhe did leave her cruelty towards you, in yeelding that recompence which your valour meriteth; and I doe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelfe, here is none in this company who doth not promiſe as much: wherefore if you deſire we ſhould employ our ſelves for you, and that you doe not leſſen us ſo much, as to beleeve our interceſſion is unprofitable, or that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not ſo much of your ſelfe, to thinke you have no need of our helpe, tell us this faire ones name who hath the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to poſſeſſe you, to the, end embracing your paſsion, we may in ſome meaſure requite (and I in particular) ſo many ineſtimable good turnes wherewith you have obliged mee. <hi>Liſander</hi> ſeeing himſelfe ſet upon on all ſides, and by <hi>Caliſta</hi> her ſelfe, who could not better witneſſe the great confidence which ſhe had in his diſcretion, anſwered her thus: Madam, although I doe not name my Miſtreſſe unto you, it is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of my preſumption; neither if I doe name her, is it out of any hope of any bodies favour, but hers onely, becauſe as I am not ſo vaine to preſume that I can merit her, ſo can I not beleeve, that all the prayers in the world can prevaile
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7258:28"/>
with her beyond her duty. Now there is ſo great diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene her merits and my wants, that there is nothing more contrarie to her duty than loving of mee: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, Madam, I value your favour ſo highly (your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is ſo deare unto me, and I have ſworne ſo much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience) that although I have promiſed never to name her, yet there is no body living, unto whom I would more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly name her than unto your ſelfe, upon condition you will alſo promiſe me never to ſpeake of it, untill ſhee permits the publiſhing thereof. I had rather never know it, than bee tyed to this condition, anſwered <hi>Caliſta</hi>: but ſeeing you will not content our curioſity this way, ſatisfie me another way; we will quit you for a Song, provided that you will ſing it to the Lute, I doe conjure you (ſaid ſhee) by her love, and in favour of all this faire company who entreat you. Now ſhe knew that <hi>Liſander</hi> played excellent well upon the Lute, and that having an excellent voice, did accord it with ſo much art, that there was no ſweetneſſe in the world comparable unto it, nor no heart ſo hard, that could avoid being charmed therewith; yet he would have been excuſed, though not like unto Muſitians, who will never ſing when they are entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor hold their peace when they are bidden: ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe conjured by the thing in the world which hee held moſt deare, he ſaid, Madam, you demand ſuch poore ſmall courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, whereas the greateſt are due, that although I am the moſt unable that can be to content you, yet had I rather erre in obedience, than excuſe my ſelfe by reaſon. So receiving the Lute from <hi>Calista,</hi> he began to touch it ſo ſweetly, that all thoſe who walked in the Hall, came about him; but when hee added his voice, it brought ſo great a ſilence, that the mindes of all the hearers; raviſhed with this wonderfull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſeemed to bee deprived of all motion in the body. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one admired at the incomparable perfections of this Knight, every body had their eyes fixed upon the beauty of his face, and their eares chained unto the ſweetneſſe of his tongue. Now was remembred the grace which did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him in his ordinary converſation with his friends, and his invincible courage, which drew him victorious from the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7258:29"/>
danger of his enemies, and wherewith he finiſhed ſo many brave deeds of armes in his youth: He ſung verſes which he had made when he was in <hi>Reyne Berke,</hi> then when he being aſſailed within and without, and being to defend himſelfe from love and his enemies; hee who gave life unto others, could not have it for himſelfe, and complaining of <hi>Calista</hi>'s cruelty under the name of <hi>Hipolita,</hi> ſaid:</p>
            <l>
               <hi>Hipolita</hi> faire, if in the end</l>
            <l>I for your ſake muſt yeeld my breath,</l>
            <l>I never could my choice amend,</l>
            <l>In finding out a ſweeter death.</l>
            <l>But yet alas what cruelty</l>
            <l>Procureth you to make me dye!</l>
            <l>Onely in loving till this time,</l>
            <l>To ſerve you was mine enterpriſe:</l>
            <l>And if to love you be a vice,</l>
            <l>Then to be lovely is a crime.</l>
            <p>
               <hi>Liſanders</hi> laſt words, pronounced with the grace of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and mingled with ſome teares, let them know, that he was truely amorous, and touched the heart, not alone of the Ladies, but alſo of the Knights, ſo deepely, that compaſſion ſprung up in ſtead of envie. <hi>Caliſta</hi> her ſelfe was moved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo great pity, that ſhee repented of her intreating him to ſing. Thus all the company being raiſed into admiration, and their memories filled with this object, loſt themſelves in this pleaſure. Being now night, there came a Page into the Hall, who asking to ſpeak with <hi>Liſander,</hi> was ledde unto the place where hee was environed with the Ladies: there the Page ſaid aloud unto him, Sir, there is at the doore a Lady, who hearing of your ſafe arrivall home, ſendeth you a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night by mee, which ſhe had rather give you her ſelfe, if you would bee pleaſed to take the paines to goe downe into the ſtreet, <hi>Liſander,</hi> as the courteouſeſt Knight living, had not the leiſure to aske the Page what Lady it was, deſiring rather to ſee her, than to loſe time in informing himſelfe, ſo much hee feared to make her attend: wherefore riſing up from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7258:29"/>
the Ladies, with great reverence unto them, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Page, leaving <hi>Caliſta</hi> with a new ſuſpition, that this was ſome new Miſtreſſe, who had part in that, which ſhee thought ſhee wholly poſſeſſed. In the meane time <hi>Liſander</hi> going out of the Hall, found foure men armed at the doore: two of whom preſently clapped the doore after him, and the other two inſtantly catching faſt hold about his middle, ſtabbed him into the body with their Poniards. <hi>Liſander</hi> finding himſelfe wounded, and not being able to draw his ſword, held them very hard with his armes, and with his nimble ſtrength (wherein he, if any man, excelled) lifted them both up from the ground, and being upon the toppe of the ſtaires, he miſsing his footing, they all three fell downe the ſtaires together. The two who had ſhut the hall doore, came running downe the ſtaires after him, and there finding <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> graſped betweene the other two, and wallowing all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his blood, thruſt him twice thorow the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee could draw his ſword. The noiſe which was made, as well in ſhutting the doore, as in falling downe the ſtaires, together with the clamours of a Page, who cryed out that they murdered his Maſter, gave an alarum unto all the houſe: Some cryed out to have the ſtreet doore ſhut, others began to breake open the hall doore; <hi>Alcidon, Lidian, Clarangeus,</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> with their ſwords in their hands, leapt out of the windowes of the hall which looked into the Court, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the foure murtherers (who endeavoured to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, having (as they thought) diſpatched <hi>Liſander</hi>) there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan betweene them a bloudy combate: for beſides that they were valiant men, the neceſsity wherein they were, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing to ſave their lives otherwiſe than by their ſwords, enforced them to a greater reſolution, together that being armed to the very throats, againſt men who had onely their ſwords, they were with leſſe feare, and bare themſelves more hazzardouſly than otherwiſe they would have done. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the courage and the nimbleneſſe of the others was ſo great, and the fury wherein they were through <hi>Liſanders</hi> death, which they did account certaine, that, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all advantages, they came victoriouſly off. The firſt who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7258:30"/>
atchieved any thing in revenge of <hi>Liſander,</hi> was <hi>Lidian,</hi> who entring with a point upon his enemy, lighted juſt betweene his arme and the curats, and run him cleane thorow: almoſt in the ſame time, <hi>Alcidon</hi> having cloſed with his adverſary, and overthrowne him, diſarmed his head, and without pity cut his throat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarangeus</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> caſting themſelves deſperately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe two, who were againſt them, got them downe, and killed them with the very Poniards wherewith they had wounded (though moſt cowardly) the moſt valiant <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>; who being found by <hi>Cleander</hi> after he had broken down the hall doore (in the plight we have ſpoken of) was carried unto a bedde (having loſt his knowledge with his blood) without moving, and almoſt without breathing. There <hi>Cleander,</hi> who, beſides the perfect love which hee bare him, was obliged for his liberty, <hi>Alcidon</hi> to whom hee had ſpared it, being in his power to kill him, <hi>Lidian</hi> whoſe life hee had twice ſaved, and <hi>Clarangeus</hi> whom he had ſerved againſt <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> began to make ſuch lamentations as are not to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Above all, <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Argire</hi> wept as bitterly as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before they had heard him ſing ſweetly. But the faire <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi> ſeeing the moſt lovely Knight, and beſt loving her of all others, carried all bloody and pale (though lovely) as if death had taken that ſhape to make her in love with it, received ſo feelingly his wounds into her heart, that without complaint or teares, immoveable as a Statue, the violence of the evill ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all ſenſe, ſhe fell downe into a ſwoune, as far from ſhewing any token of life as her friend was; in which plight ſhe was carried unto another bed. The Surgeons, who in all diligence were ſent for, having ſearched <hi>Liſanders</hi> wounds, were not able to reſolve of his recovery, and leſſe able to ſtanch the blood, or keepe him from his ſwouning; which made every body deſpaire of his life: onely <hi>Lidian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring himſelfe of an <hi>Operator</hi> who had formerly cured him, ſo excellent in his skill, that he not only ſtayed the blood with a word, but healed the moſt mortall wounds with an incredible facility; went out of the houſe in all haſte, without ſpeaking a word to any man, and ſtayed not before hee was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7258:30"/>
with this <hi>Operator</hi>: but hee found him in his bedde, and ſo ſicke, that it was not poſsible for him to riſe; Yet ſir, ſaid he, ſend me the wounded mans doublet, and if he bee not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely dead when I receive it, I will aſſure you his life. <hi>Lidian</hi> being unable to comprehend this, and fearing to loſe time, together with his friends life, he returned with the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence wherewith hee went, and brought him the ſame doublet which was taken off from <hi>Liſander,</hi> whom he found in the ſame eſtate wherein he left him: but being returned the ſecond time unto <hi>Cleanders,</hi> he found that <hi>Liſanders</hi> wounds were cloſed, and his bloud ſtopped, neither could the Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more than any of the company, tell the cauſe. Then did he tell them what hee had done, whereat they all wondred: But the old Gentleman, whom <hi>Cleander</hi> had left with <hi>Caliſta</hi> when he went into Holland, told them that he had ſeene the very like practiſed in the perſon of the father of S. <hi>Andrew de Vins,</hi> a brave Gentleman of Provence, knowne by them all, who being at the ſiege of <hi>Rochel</hi> Squire unto <hi>Monſieur,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Hen.</hi> the third, caſt himſelfe before his Mr. when he ſaw a Harquebuſh levelled and diſcharged at him, whereby hee received the ſhot in his breaſt, and was healed by a man who never ſaw any thing but his doublet. Shortly after <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> came unto himſelfe, which <hi>Cleander</hi> ran preſently to tell unto <hi>Calista</hi>; who being a little before recovered, received with this new cauſe of joy for hope of <hi>Liſanders</hi> life, a new occaſion of affliction, out of feare that ſhe had diſcovered her love. Nevertheleſſe it was received by <hi>Cleander,</hi> as an honeſt and pitifull affection which ſhe truely bare unto the vertues and merits of <hi>Liſander,</hi> who having recovered knowledge, with ſo feeble a voice that he could hardly be heard, had yet loſt the memory of all that was paſt; neither did hee know why, or whereof he was ſicke. The Surgeons forbad him to ſpeake: and after they had conſidered of all things that were fit for his recovery, they bethought themſelves of the cauſe of this aſſaſination. No body could imagine from whom it ſhould proceed; for <hi>Liſander</hi> had no enemies, at the leaſt which were diſcovered, and thoſe who had ſo wickedly wounded him, being diſarmed after they were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7258:31"/>
dead, could not be knowne. In the end, the Page whom they had at firſt ſent, was found hid behinde a doore, who being brought unto <hi>Cleander,</hi> confeſſed that this match was ſet by a couzen of <hi>Cloridons,</hi> who was firſt killed by <hi>Lidian</hi>; hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to revenge upon <hi>Liſander</hi> the blow which was given in the tilting, had with thoſe three others, who were all <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridons</hi> ſervants or friends, ſworne <hi>Liſanders</hi> death. <hi>Cleander</hi> and all the company were extremely offended, and went all the next morning at the Kings riſing to complaine of the attempt, and to demand juſtice againſt thoſe whom they had killed: but <hi>Cloridon</hi> demanding it alſo with them, and witneſsing more ſorrow for <hi>Liſanders</hi> wounds, than for the others death, teſtified that he knew nothing of ſo divelliſh an enterprize: And the King, who loved them all, deſiring to make them friends, expreſſed, that for the love hee bare <hi>Cloridon,</hi> he ſhould be glad if they would content themſelves with their deaths, who had worthily received it as a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their fault: wherefore all things ſo reſted; the dead were dead, <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Liſander</hi> wounded, were afterwards made friends by the Kings command.</p>

In the meane time, <hi>Lidian</hi> and <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> not able longer to endure <hi>Olinda</hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, went both of them to her at her houſe, where ſhee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them, not to take it in evill part, if for ſome important reaſons which ſhe would not ſpeake, ſhe did conjure them for ſome time to deprive her of the honour which ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their company. This ſhee ſaid with great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7258:32"/>
of ſorrow, ſeeing her ſelfe conſtrained to make this requeſt unto them: Both of them witneſſing as much obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto her as love, promiſed to forbeare, although this baniſhment were more cruell unto them, than any torment which her rigour could have inflicted. <hi>Alcidon</hi> (who made the third in this buſineſſe) remonſtrating unto them what extremities they were brought unto by their jealouſie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made them commit a fault, a relapſe whereinto could not bee but inexcuſable and mortall; intreated them to give this paſſion unto their friendſhip, or at the leaſt not to take it away, having once given it before: and if they loved <hi>Olinda,</hi> they ought not to conſtraine her good will by violence, nor make her odious unto all the world, as being the cauſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding ſo ancient, and perfect a friendſhip as theirs was, with many other reaſons: ſo that they promiſed not to forbeare loving of her, for that was not in their power, but at the leaſt to abſtaine from ſeeing her, as they had promiſed.</p>
            <p>This promiſe was for ſome dayes religiouſly kept by the two friends, who would not by any means be juſtly tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for wronging each others friendſhip, but beleeving that they ſhould either vanquiſh, or by diverſion wipe away their love and jealouſie, ſeeing every day all ſorts of objects excepting that which was moſt fixt in their imagination: But <hi>Clarangeus</hi> having taken a lodging neere unto <hi>Olinda</hi>'s, to the end he might ſee at his window, as ſhe went in and out at the doore, her whom hee durſt not goe to ſee in the houſe, (as lovers have ſtrange phantaſies, and content themſelves with what they can get, when they cannot get what they would) made <hi>Lidian</hi> thinke this his taking of a houſe was no apt meanes to make him forget her. Wherefore beleeving that hee was diſpenſed of his promiſe, and no more to bee bound to the oath which was firſt broken by his rivall, hee found the meanes to meet <hi>Olinda</hi> one evening in the garden of the <hi>Tuilleryes,</hi> where ſhe was gone to walk, &amp; there (with ſome teares) complaining of the torment which hee ſuffered in his abſence, by the commandement which ſhe had given not to ſee her, which <hi>Clarangeus</hi> had diſobeyed, in taking a houſe ſo neere hers; expreſſed his love ſo lively unto her, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7258:32"/>
               <hi>Olinda</hi> who truely loved him, and did not like that <hi>Claran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geus</hi> had taken a lodging ſo neere hers, beleeving that he had done it to obſerve her actions, ſuffered him to ſee her at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain houres; which ſhee did aſſigne unto him ſo ſecretly, that it was not perceived by <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> although her neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Theſe viſites were by night: <hi>Olinda</hi> retired her ſelfe earely, and went late to bed; and when every one elſe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, <hi>Lidian,</hi> without any followers or light, was brought into her houſe, and ſpent a great part of the night with her, although with all the honeſt reſpect which could bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene honourable lovers: But the Moone, envious of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> fortune, diſcovered him to jealous <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> who watching like a Dragon at a window which looked into the ſtreet a little upon the one ſide from his Miſtreſſes, ſaw him come out from thence about two houres after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. The unfitneſſe of the time, and the aſtoniſhment to ſee him come from a place where his word and friendſhip had barred him the entrance, raiſed ſuch humours in his braine, that hee could hardly containe himſelfe: and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the cauſe of his complaint, <hi>Lidian</hi> being in the ſtreet, and <hi>Olinda</hi> in her window, they tooke new leave one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (without thinking or remembring of their neighbour) with ſuch amorous words from <hi>Lidian,</hi> and ſo favourable from <hi>Olinda,</hi> that <hi>Clarangeus</hi> fell from an ague into a feaver; and <hi>Lidian</hi> (as if he had not had leiſure in two houres, which he was with her to ſpeake, ſo blinde are both love and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) intreated her to fling him downe her handkerchiefe, that he might have the contentment to lodge with it, and to embrace it all night, in remembrance of the deereſt perſon unto him in the world. <hi>Olinda,</hi> who was otherwayes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and wiſe, ſo farre yeelded unto his prayers, that as well to ſatisfie his importunity, as not to let him ſtay any longer there, caſt it unto him, thinking that he would goe his way ſo ſoone as he had taken it up: But the wind, jealous of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, blew it upon the barres of <hi>Clarangeus</hi> window, who ſaw this action with a motion of ſo violent a paſſion, that impatience and rage were likely to have carried him into the ſtreet, there to decide by a laſt combate the difference and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7258:33"/>
jealouſie of their love. <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Lidian</hi> were in no leſſe pain, perceiving (although too late) their undiſcreet improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; yet her Gentlewoman running ſpeedily with a pole, got down the handkerchiefe, which <hi>Lidian</hi> catching before it came unto the ground, and in his Miſtreſſes ſight lovingly kiſſing it, retired himſelfe, leaving unto her a good night, and unto <hi>Clarangeus</hi> the worſt that ever hee felt. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they failed not to meet at the Maſſe, rather to ſee <hi>Olinda</hi> than for any devotion: where <hi>Clarangeus</hi> comming unto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> ſaid, You cannot now deny that you have not ſeene Madam <hi>Olinda,</hi> both againſt her command and your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

            <p>
               <hi>Clarangeus</hi> provoked with this anſwer, ſaid, Wherein have I broken my promiſe? I yet never did it, and doe well know the meanes to compell others to performe what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. You need not compell (anſwered <hi>Lidian</hi>) thoſe who are ready to pay: and you did breake your word, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſed not to ſee Madam <hi>Olinda,</hi> you tooke a lodging cloſe unto hers. Well Sir, anſwered <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> I would not ſo lightly have departed from your friendſhip, as you have from mine; but this is the truth, herein I am your enemy. Sir, anſwered <hi>Lidian,</hi> I will alwayes oppoſe my ſervices unto your hatred: But I entreat you to conſider, that our promiſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall, and hath no more force than my Ladies comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement gave it; and if you (nevertheleſſe) beleeve that I have ſooner broken my word than you, pardon it unto mee, and thinke that I have no more power of my ſelfe, than you have of your ſelfe. The holineſſe of the place, and their friends which did accompany them, interrupting their diſcourſe, they heard Maſſe together with <hi>Olinda,</hi> who underſtood part of their diſpute, and was no leſſe offended with <hi>Lidians</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, than with <hi>Clarangeus</hi> complaints; who was the more provoked at that time by <hi>Lidians</hi> holding of the handkerchief againſt his mouth. Their friends having ſent to ſeeke for <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Cleander,</hi> and they comming, the beſt meanes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7258:33"/>
they could finde to agree them, was to entreat them that their differences might be determined by her will, who was the cauſe thereof. <hi>Lidian</hi> at the firſt word conſented hereunto, aſſuring himſelfe of <hi>Olinda</hi>'s favour: but <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his cauſe, would not referre himſelfe unto the judgement of a woman, already gained by his adverſary; yet <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Cleander</hi> uſed ſo many perſwaſions unto him, that hee yeelded, if <hi>Olinda</hi> made choice of <hi>Lidian</hi> for her ſervant, <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangeus</hi> ſhould leave her ſervice, and ſhould never pretend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intereſt in her love; and in like manner, if ſhe ſhould rather chuſe <hi>Clarangeus, Lidian</hi> ſhould forbeare any further ſuit, and never come in any place where he might hope for grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from her. Commiſſion to deliver this agreement unto <hi>Olinda,</hi> was given unto thoſe who had made it, and their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were ingaged to the performance of theſe conditions, declaring themſelves enemies unto the firſt breakers thereof. <hi>Olinda</hi> being equally offended with them both, beleeving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that ſhe had power to call backe <hi>Lidian</hi> when ſhe pleaſed, and not thinking it fit to make choice of one, and offend the other, reſolved to bee rid of them both, entreating both the one and the other to abſent themſelves, and promiſing to chooſe him for her husband who ſhould laſt come unto her. The Oracle proceeding from this mortall goddeſſe, ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by thoſe who asked it, ſo aſtoniſhed <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> but moſt <hi>Lidian,</hi> that the next morning, without communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their deſigne, or taking leave of any perſon, they got to horſe, leaving the Court, and all their friends in great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>In the meane time feeble <hi>Liſander</hi> by little and little reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his ſtrength, and no leſſe by <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s charmes than by the <hi>Operators</hi> skill (who onely applyed his ſalves unto the doublet) loſt the paine of his wounds: The contentment which he received in her company was ſo great, that fearing to loſe that, he was unwilling to be healed; out of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, when ſhe asked of him how his wounds were, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Better than I would, Madam, becauſe the happineſſe which I receive in your moſt deare company, doth infinitely ſurpaſſe the paine which they put me to: and I doe ſo much
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7258:34"/>
feare the loſing of this glory when I ſhall bee healed, that to preſerve it eternally, I could wiſh them incurable. <hi>Caliſta</hi> gently ſmiled at theſe words, and told him, that hee ſhould onely take care for the healing of them, and after they ſhould enjoy more pleaſure being whole, than in being ſicke. But what pleaſure Madam, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> can I hope from your rigour, if you uſe mee alwaies according unto your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner? You complaine without cauſe, replyed <hi>Caliſta,</hi> knowing (as you doe well) unto what extremity I have beene reduced to pleaſe you: but as it is ſaid, to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be healed is a beginning of health; only be willing to be healed, that I may ſee you once doe what I deſire. With theſe ſweet words <hi>Liſander</hi> thought that <hi>Caliſta</hi> did but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the remedy of his love, untill the healing of his wounds did make him capable of the receiving thereof: And thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his hope with his evill, unſenſibly he was reduced to his former health. But then when <hi>Liſander</hi> thought to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fruit of this love, for which hee had ſuffered ſo many rigorous abſences, travels, and wounds, and that <hi>Cleanders, Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> riding after <hi>Lidian</hi> and <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> who being gone this very day (as wee ſaid) put them all in feare that they were gone to fight; made him hope of a favourable occaſion to enjoy his Miſtreſſe. She entring (with <hi>Clarinda</hi>) into his chamber, ſpake thus unto him: Sir, ſince the time that I ſuffered you to ſee mee at <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> unknowne to my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I have beene alwaies followed with a multitude of torments, which have never left mee in peace; and I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God hath juſtly ſuffered them to puniſh in me the wicked deſigne which you have had to diſhonour a perſon who entirely loveth you, although I have committed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offence, but ſuffering that which I could not hinder, and that I did not give notice of an injury which you procure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, who ought to be more deare unto me than you are, and who ought to bee more deare unto you than I am. This hath beene confirmed unto me in this laſt affliction, which I have had for your wounds; in which time I made a vow to God, that if he ſhewed you ſo much mercy as to ſuffer you to eſcape, I would never draw his anger upon my head, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7258:34"/>
any connivence with your crime: I doe entreat you therefore Sir, and conjure you by that love which you ſay, and I beleeve you beare me, that if you will love mee, you would love mee honourably, and according to the love which I owe unto <hi>Cleander,</hi> and the friendſhip which hee beares you; if not, I doe moſt humbly entreat you to pardon me, if in paying the vow which I have made unto God, and in ſatisfying the juſt obligations which are amongſt men, I am conſtrained to entreat you to retire your ſelfe, and uſe that great courage (which you make appeare in every danger) to ſuffer conſtantly the loſſe of a perſon, who cannot be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lawfully by you.</p>
            <p>I would faine have all thoſe who are apprehenſive of love, think with what patience <hi>Liſander</hi> could heare a ſpeech ſo little looked for, at the inſtant when hee expected the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsing of a pleaſure, ſo long, and ſo vainly followed. Ha, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered he, is it poſsible that in the midſt of ſo many faire hopes, which you have made me conceive of your pity, you ſhould uſe mee ſo cruelly? Is this the recompence of ſo many ſervices which I have done you, of ſo many dangers whereinto I have throwne my ſelfe, of ſo many wounds which I have received, and ſo many paſsions which I yet ſuffer? Had it not beene better you had then ſuffered mee to dye when I was ſo neere death, when I ſhould have felt no paine (it being a kinde of pity to kill thoſe quickly which of neceſsity muſt dye) rather than to make me ſuffer it with ſo much violence after ſo much ſweetneſſe, having prolonged my life to prolong my torment? Alas, it was not without cauſe I feared to bee healed too ſoone, ſeeing that in recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my health, I loſe your favour; and then to faine a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit vow to excuſe your ingratitude, and cover your cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the cloake of Religion, will not heaven puniſh this hypocriſie? <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Caliſta,</hi> I will ſpeak but one word, after which I entreat you not to hope for any other: I take the ſame heaven to witneſſe (which you doe invoke againſt me) that I grieve that I cannot love you as you love me; and doe wiſh that I may be puniſhed according to your deſire, if I uſe either hypocriſie or diſsimulation: You wrongfully
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7258:35"/>
accuſe mee of ingratitude and cruelty, ſeeing I cannot ſatisfie you, without being ungratefull unto <hi>Cleander</hi>; nor have pity upon you, without being cruell unto my ſelfe. I have told you that I loved you, and with ſo perfect a love, that it could not bee encreaſed nor leſſened ſince the firſt birth thereof; neither am I ignorant of your merits towards me, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I told you what hindered me from acknowledging them, and to let you ſee that you loſe the glory of your good turnes by the recompence which you require: is there any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of juſtice or reaſon, that for having ſaved my fathers, my brothers, and my husbands lives, you ſhould bind me to make them loſe their honour? Do you think, that if I ſhould forget my ſelfe ſo farre, I could excuſe my ſelfe upon the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations wherein I am tyed unto you, and juſtifie the injury which I ſhould doe them by the ſervices which you have done unto me? Content your ſelfe that I have no leſſe griefe to give you this command, than you have to receive it; and the ſame paſſion which you feele, becauſe you cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which you unlawfully deſire, I ſuffer, becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lawfully yeeld it unto you. At this word <hi>Caliſta</hi> went out of the doore, leaving <hi>Liſander</hi> in that confuſion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity which may eaſily bee imagined. Hee went three or foure times about the chamber, ſat down, and roſe, caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon his bedde, and not finding in any place the reſt which he every where ſought for, after a thouſand diſcourſes in his imagination, as little reſolved as he was at the firſt, hee uſed theſe words: O ungratefull woman, and I more foole to thinke the earth could beare other! Well, <hi>Caliſta,</hi> death ſhall free mee from thy cruelty (if thy tyranny doth not ſtretch after death) and ſo thou ſhalt avoide the ſight of mee, but not of my Ghoſt, which, together with the Furies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers of my blood, ſhall alwayes hang about thy necke; yet I will not dye before I my ſelfe have enjoyed the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my revenge, and doe ſhew thee, that I am as able to hurt thee as to oblige thee. Was there no meanes but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of courteſie (like a gentle bit in a horſe mouth) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine me to endure this womans indignities? But ſtay thy madneſſe, <hi>Liſander</hi>; thou thy ſelfe art both ungratefull and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7258:35"/>
diſloyall, whereof thou complaineſt: baſe as thou art, thou doeſt with infidelity and treachery go about to deceive thy friend; thou doeſt alſo injurie <hi>Caliſta,</hi> becauſe ſhe will not conſent unto thy wickedneſſe. Alas, who ſhall puniſh mee for theſe crimes? and if I be not puniſhed, who ſhall ever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me?</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſometimes injuring <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and then cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her mercy, digeſted his bitterneſſe with ſo much anguiſh, that hee thought hee ſhould end his life with the day: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Cleander,</hi> who in the morning left him in good diſpoſition, comming home at night with <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus</hi> without hearing newes either of <hi>Lidian</hi> or <hi>Clarangeus</hi> found him ſicke in his bed: Yet he roſe early in the morning before Sun, and went unto <hi>Cleander,</hi> who was a bed with <hi>Caliſta,</hi> unto whom (having given him good morrovv) hee ſaid, that reſting better this night, than hee had done (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with terrible diſquiets, out of the feare hee had that <hi>Clarangeus</hi> and <hi>Lidian</hi> might fight againe) he found himſelfe ſo well, that he was reſolved never to reſt untill hee had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found the one or the other. But my deare friend (ſaid <hi>Cleander</hi>) the weake eſtate wherein you are, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you; Leſſe will my care ſuffer mee to take reſt, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> for if it ſhould happen ſo unfortunately that they ſhould fight againe, I ſhould never enjoy my life; When (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Cleander</hi>) will you come againe? So ſoone as I ſhall find them, anſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>; who having embraced him, went from him unto the ſide of the bedde where <hi>Caliſta</hi> lay; unto whom (in ſaluting her) he ſaid aloud: Madam, I ſhould leave you with more ſorrow, if I did not know how acceptable the ſervice will be which I goe about to doe unto you. <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> beleeved that hee ſpake this in reſpect of <hi>Lidian,</hi> but <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta</hi> better apprehending his ſpeeches, referred them to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture: yet faining to underſtand them in the other ſenſe, anſwered thus: Sir, you have tyed us in ſo many bonds, that although you bring backe my brother, hardly can wee bee more obliged; for debts being infinite cannot bee encreaſed; and from this infiniteneſſe it followes, that not onely your ſervices are agreeable, but all your other actions in reſpect of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7258:36"/>
them, although they were not ſo in their owne nature; but onely your departure, which, in regard it doth deprive us of the contentment wee receive in your company, cannot bee pleaſing unto us. <hi>Liſander</hi> ſaid nothing unto this, but having kiſſed her, went his way ſpeaking to himſelfe; O treacherous <hi>Caliſta,</hi> how artificially doſt thou hide thy malice, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſt ſweetneſſe with cruelty! From thence he went to take leave of <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Berontus,</hi> who would at any hand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him: but he remonſtrated unto them, that it was much better for them to ſeparate themſelves, the eaſier to finde their friends. So going alone, hee tooke his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Burgundy, and ſtayed not before he was come unto a ſiſter of his called <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> who had beene married in that countrey, and then was a young widow, rich, of a great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of an excellent beauty, who receiving her brother as the deareſt thing in the world, could not ſo divert his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, but that after hee had ſtrove the ſpace of a moneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his love, hee yeelded to the violence thereof, and fell from this melancholy into a ſtrange ſickeneſſe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the moſt admirable effects, that ever memory hath heard. In the meane time, <hi>Cleander</hi> having a journey to make into Italy, to diſpoſe of ſome poſſeſſions which hee had in Naples, into which place for the like effect hee was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to goe every three yeeres, left <hi>Berontus</hi> with <hi>Calista,</hi> and <hi>Caliſta</hi> accompanied with the heavieſt ſolitarineſſe that ever ſhe was reduced unto. And unto him there happened this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, ſo memorable, that (I think) the like is ſeldome found in any hiſtory: He being gone a great way in Italy, to a place called <hi>Aquapendent,</hi> at which place alwaies in his journey to Naples hee was accuſtomed to lodge: the place was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient enough, and <hi>Cleander</hi> came ſo late, that the lodgings were all taken, and hee forced to travell further, or lye in the ſtreets. He asked to ſpeake with his old Hoſt, who (ſaid hee) before hee would have ſuffered mee to bee thus unprovided, would have lyen out of his owne bedde for me. Anſwer was made, that his old Hoſt was dead; yet there was a chamber where a bedde (if he pleaſed) ſhould be made for him, but of late time it had beene frequented with ſpirits, for which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7258:36"/>
cauſe no man durſt lye there. Let me have a bedde there, ſaid <hi>Cleander,</hi> I had rather lye there with them, than in the ſtreets with my men. A bedde was then made in a chamber, which he knew to be the very ſame, wherein he was accuſtomably lodged in the life time of his old Hoſt; where having ſupped with his people, and being readie for his bedde, his ſervants retired to looke for ſuch lodgings as the ſtraitneſſe of the houſe would affoord; leaving him with the doore ſhut un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſitting by the fire ſide, preſently hee heard a noiſe at the door, and turning his head that way, he ſaw a man come into the chamber, of the ſame ſhape, proportion, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that his dead Hoſt was, who comming unto the chair wherein <hi>Cleander</hi> ſate, ſtood ſtill, ſtedfaſtly looking him in the face, without doing or ſaying any thing. <hi>Cleander,</hi> whoſe heart was capable of any thing but feare, felt nevertheleſſe an unknowne ſhivering run thorow all his veines, which curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his blood; yet he had the heart to ſay unto him, Good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my Hoſt, I was told you were dead: So I am, anſwered the Spirit. How then come you here, anſwered <hi>Cleander?</hi> I come to tell you that I am killed (ſaid hee) and withall to intreat you, by our ancient acquaintance, that you will cauſe me to be buried: you ſhall finde my body in ſuch a pit, under a great heap of ſtones which have beene caſt upon me. I doe conjure you once againe to give me buriall. Well mine Hoſt, anſwered <hi>Cleander,</hi> to morrow I will cauſe you to be buried. Will you no other thing? No, ſaid the Spirit; and giving him good night, retired, leaving <hi>Cleander</hi> more deſirous to ſee day than to ſleep: yet he was not further troubled all that night. The next morning riſing very early, he ſent for the Juſtice of the place, unto whom having recited the viſion which he ſaw, not ſleeping but waking, and before hee went to bed, hee led him unto the pit which the Spirit had told him of, and finding it full of ſtones, they cauſed it to be emptied, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they found the body which lay under them, eaſily known to be the old Hoſt: every body was aſtoniſhed at the fact. <hi>Cleander</hi> left the information of the cauſe unto the Juſtice, and to acquit himſelfe of his promiſe to the Hoſt, cauſed him to bee buried with an honourable ſervice; wherein having
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7258:37"/>
ſpent all that day, hee reſolved to lye that night againe in the chamber. Being there alone, much about the houre that hee came the night before, my Hoſte came againe, and at his entrance into the chamber, hee ſaid, God give you a good evening Sir. <hi>Cleander,</hi> who could willingly have ſpared this viſitation, anſwered him, Good even my Hoſte: have I not performed my promiſe? Yes Sir, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Spirit, I am now come to thanke you, and to tell you, that if you pleaſe to command me any thing where I goe, there is nothing which I can doe for you, that I will not doe. Friend (anſwered <hi>Cleander</hi>) there is nothing that I have to doe in that countrey which you ſpeake of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God give you Peace, and the Reſt which you deſire. The like I wiſh unto you, ſaid the Spirit, and ſo Sir I bid you farewell. Farewell my Hoſt, ſaid <hi>Cleander</hi>; unto whom theſe complements began to be troubleſome Nevertheleſſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being at the doore ready to goe away, <hi>Cleander</hi> called him againe, and ſaid unto him, Mine Hoſt, one word with you. The Spirit returning, ſaid, What is your pleaſure; Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I intreat you, ſaid <hi>Cleander,</hi> if you have any power where you goe, you would oblige mee ſo farre, as to advertiſe me of my death three dayes before I dye. Well, anſwered the Spirit, I will doe it if I can. Thereupon hee vaniſhed, and <hi>Cleander</hi> preſently after going to bed, ſlept till the morning; neither he nor any other ever after either hearing or ſeeing any thing in that Chamber.</p>
            <p>In this time <hi>Liſander</hi> lying at his ſiſters houſe in Burgundy very ſicke, fell into that weakeneſſe, that hee loſt all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and was given over by the Phyſitians (who were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his diſeaſe) unto the prayers of the religious. Hee had loſt both ſpeech and ſight, and when he recovered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was onely to ſee fearefull illuſions; or ſpeake raving, or doe ſuch extravagant actions as never entre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7258:37"/>
to exhort him with conſtancy to give up his life, unto him who was the author thereof. At her ſending, two Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins came, before whom <hi>Liſander</hi> fell into ſo grievous a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, that among other things which he vomited up at his mouth, he caſt up Pen-knives, Inke-hornes, Images of waxe, Bracelets of haire, Cart-nailes: which were not illuſions, and fained, but ſo reall and true, that they yet remaine in the hands of the Capuchins, and are kept as perpetuall reliques unto their Covent. Theſe good Fathers ſeeing ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a Prodigie, lifted up their eyes and voices to heaven, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to have pity upon this Knights ſoule, whoſe body they thought was ſo neere an end.

Emplore his aide, hee neither can nor will refuſe any perſon relying upon him: for, what can hee refuſe unto us, having given himſelfe for us? ſo much leſſening himſelfe, as to be borne baſely, to live poorely, to dye ſhamefully, that if his divinity had not beene witneſſed, not alone by men living and dead, but by Angels and by Devils, the obeying of the windes and waters, by the trembling of the earth, and darkning of the Sunne; it would bee impoſſible to receive it in our beleefe. <hi>Liſander</hi> eaſed by the voiding of theſe things which hee had vomited, and comforted by the remonſtrance of this good religious man, lifted up his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This good man diſcovering then his head, which was almoſt hid under his Coule, and making himſelfe knowne unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> with teares in his eyes in kiſsing him, ſaid, if nothing were wanting unto your health, but the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7258:38"/>
of theſe two cauſes of aſtoniſhment, I durſt promiſe my ſelfe to ſee you well; no leſſe aſtoniſhing the company with the Miracle of your healing, than it is yet with the wonder of your evill: For the things which you have vomited, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are true, and ſeeme to be truely come out of your body, ought rather to bee aſcribed to the illuſions of the evill Spirit, who hath deceived our ſenſe, than unto the teſtimony of our owne eyes. And it is to bee beleeved that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſeeing they are palpable: But it is to be beleeved alſo that hee hath charmed our ſight, as the <hi>Operator,</hi> who laſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, charmed your wounds and healed them, in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalves to your Doublet. And it is likely that from this firſt charme, proceeds now this ſecond: For the Devill hath done nothing for nothing, and did not ſuccour you in that extremity, but onely to reduce you into a greater. As for your aſtoniſhment, which proceedeth from my knowing you, I thinke it is now wiped away: And <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> having beene ſo perfect a friend unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> cannot be unknowne by ſo ſtrange a change as mine, or by the violence of a ſickneſſe like yours. For the reſt, you have reaſon in ſaying you have ſeene me in another world; for this wherein I now am, is much differing from that wherin I then was. <hi>Liſander,</hi> who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Clarangeus</hi> (who, caſt from ſerving, and baniſhed from the preſence of <hi>Olinda,</hi> had confined himſelfe into a Cloyſter) embracing him, with a joy mingled with ſorrow and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to ſee him in this habit, anſwered: Is it poſſible that my eyes doe not deceive me, <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> and that it is not one of the illuſions of my ſickeneſſe? how have you left the world? As thoſe (replyed <hi>Clarangeus</hi>) who being beaten by ſtormes at Sea, doe ſearch for ſome ſafe Port where they may bee covered from the tempeſt. O how happy are you, ſaid <hi>Liſander,</hi> to have that power of your ſelfe! Yea, if you knew the happineſſe, ſaid <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> and if after ſo many ſtormes wherewith you have beene beaten, you would (with mee) prove the ſweetneſſe and quietneſſe of a religious life, you would deſpiſe and mocke at Honours, Loves, and other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which caſt away the moſt part of men. I would to God, ſaid <hi>Liſander,</hi> I could doe it, but I know my ſelfe ſo

weake &amp; ſo chained to the world, that though I ſhould leave it to day; I ſhould take it againe to morrow; and, as it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily happens, my ſecond entrance would bee much worſe than my firſt. You have reaſon, replied <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> For as there is nothing worſe for health, than to paſſe from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to another; ſo there is nothing more dangerous in the world, than to goe from a religious life unto an irregular one. From thence it comes, that there is nothing more evill than a Monke, who hath caſt away his frocke; and that the moſt par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if you have no reſpect of them, at the leaſt have conſideration what your enemies will ſay; Doe you thinke that they will beleeve that Devotion hath reduced you unto this Cloyſter? no truely, they will beleeve rather that it is ſome violent paſſion of love, or ſome weakeneſſe of ſpirit, which hath rather by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire than ſound judgement tranſported you.

After hee had paid his vowes, confeſſed his ſinnes with teares, and prayed with fervency, as he roſe up from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Altar where hee had kneeled, beholding the beauty of the Temple, and the rich Tapeſtry wherewith it was adorned; hee ſaw three or foure men apparelled like ſlaves, ſtanding under a Lampe of ſilver, which was lighted before the holy Image: and one of them who by his ſhape, faſhion and action ſeemed to be maſter of the other, although hee was no better cloathed than they, asked the Sexton why this ſilver Lampe was placed before the other of gold, which was much richer and bigger than the other? who anſwered unto him in this manner; That Lampe of ſilver which you
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7258:42"/>
ſee there, was heretofore vowed by a King of France, and that which is after it, was given by our King: and as well becauſe it is gold, and ſo to be preferred before the other (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilver, leſſe alſo in quantity and quality) as becauſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unjuſt that any other whatſoever, ſhould precede our great King in his kingdome, he preceding all others in exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Empire; wee have divers times endevoured to place that of Spaine before that of France, and as often loſt our time as we did endevour it, becauſe in the next morning we found them againe in their firſt order; ſo that we have beene conſtrained to let them alone, after wee had in vaine a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times changed them. Your King (ſaid the Slave then) ought hereby to know, that there is a ſuperiour power which will not ſuffer him to diſpute the right of elderſhip with the King of France, neither did hee ever diſpute it but to his loſſe, nor ever ſhall but to his confuſion. Preſently did <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> by his geſture and ſpeech know this Slave; yet the ſtrange habit wherein he was cloathed, and great diſtance from the place where he had left him, contradicted his judgement, and made him doubt of what hee ſaw. But the Slave beholding him, and being in the like perplexity and doubt, could not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that this Pilgrime was the ſame <hi>Liſander,</hi> who foure or five months before had left him in Paris; wherefore to cleare his doubt, he came unto him, &amp; then knew him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both in face and voice.</p>

               <hi>Liſander</hi> ſeeing it was his friend <hi>Cleander,</hi> running to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, with teares of joy, asked him by what good or evill fortune he was met in a place ſo remote from his owne, and in a habite ſo differing from his condition. <hi>Cleander</hi> no leſſe raviſhed with the ſame aſtoniſhment and joy, asked him the like queſtion. The admiration of this meeting cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, they entred into greater, when they told unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the accidents which happened unto them. <hi>Liſander</hi> told him how hee had beene ſicke, and of thoſe ſtrange things which prodigiouſly hee had vomited at his mouth, and how having beene viſited by the Capuchins when all hope of life was loſt, he was knowne by <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> now entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a religious Order, whoſe converſation, together with his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7258:42"/>
owne extreme ſickeneſſe, had cauſed him to make that vow which he had there to pay, never once thinking of ſo happy an encounter. <hi>Cleander,</hi> more wondring than before at his friends relation, in exchange, told him the diſcourſe of his owne journey, and the viſion of his Hoſte; and proceeding in telling what you have heard, hee alſo ſaid, how being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Naples to Rome, and from thence to Lygorne, the convenience of a ſmall Galley which was bound for Marcels, and the deſire which hee had to haſten his returne into France, made him imbarque himſelfe: but being upon the coaſt of Genoa, they were encountred by a Pirate of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire named <hi>Marrabut,</hi> who having quickly taken them (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether without armes, and ſo without any meanes of reſiſtance) was carrying them into Affrick, when a ſtorm, favourable unto all us Captives, caſt him into the Gulfe of Barcelon, where being retaken by a Galley of Malta, which a Spaniſh Knight commanded, they were ſet at liberty; and ſeeing himſelfe ſo neere unto our Lady of Mount <hi>Serrat,</hi> hee had come thither to give thankes unto God for his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>That day, and the night following they ate and reſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they and their people (for the other Slaves with <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> were his ſervants, and <hi>Liſander</hi> had a Gentleman and two Lackeyes with him:) <hi>Cleander</hi> enquiring if hee had learnt any newes of <hi>Lidian.</hi> I did perſwade my ſelfe (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>) that I ſhould have learnt ſomething of him from <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> but he told mee, that hee had neither ſeene him not heard of him, ſince the time they departed from <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda.</hi> I much feare, ſaid <hi>Cleander,</hi> that the ſame deſpaire which wrought upon <hi>Clarang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With this talke, ſleepe, aſſiſted with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, tooke faſt hold of them, untill it was faire day next morning, which was a great feaſt unto our Lady: upon which occaſion a number of Pilgrims were come unto the Covent, when word was brought them, that they ſhould riſe, if they would heare a Hermite of the mountain preach; unto whom (in regard of the great fruite of his eloquence) it was permitted, being otherwayes againſt the rule which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7258:43"/>
forbid them, the better to follow their contemplative life. This newes made them riſe, and goe to the Church, where the Sermon was already begun, and ſo great a number of Pilgrims, that they could not come neere the Pulpit. At the firſt they perceived this Hermits Eloquence to bee accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with great youth, and excellent beauty, whereby hee no leſſe delighted his Auditors eyes with his ſight, than hee charmed their eares with his words: Hee had ſuch action in his ſpeech, and ſuch grace in his action, that he raiſed atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with no leſſe admiration than ſilence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and although he ſpake Spaniſh, hee was ſo neat in his diſcourſe, ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which could well be omitted, nor omitting any thing which ought to be ſpoken: his words were neither curious nor affected, but did properly ſignifie the things which hee would expreſſe, and were received by long uſe and cuſtome; a rule which whoſo followes cannot faile. Hee ſpake not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone from his lippes, but from his heart: neither did hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obſerve one ſound in his voice, but did carry it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of the ſubject; alwayes grave and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, full of ſentences, without ſtaying upon after repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the ſpending of his houre; ſometimes more earneſt, ſometimes more gentle, but never idely wandring from his matter. And as his words were not affected, ſo his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was not compoſed, but naturall and without art. His diſcourſe was free, but orderly: in briefe, ſo excellent, that our Pilgrims, who were borne and nouriſhed in the pure French ayre, did wonder that Spaine could bring forth ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a ſpirit: but at the end of his Sermon, having diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his head, and <hi>Liſander</hi> conſidering him more nearely, judged by many circumſtances, but principally by the ayre of his countenance, that hee had nothing in him of Spaniſh but his tongue; and leaning unto <hi>Cleander,</hi> ſaid unto him in his eare, What thinke you of this Hermite? is hee not an able man? So good, anſwered <hi>Cleander,</hi> that if hee did appeare to mee but little leſſe, I would ſay I knew him: but fearing to witneſſe my being deceived, I dare not ſpeake what I thinke. Thinke you what you will, anſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>; but if I did beleeve that <hi>Lidian</hi> were learned, and ſpake ſo good Spaniſh,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7258:43"/>
all the world ſhould not perſwade mee, that hee were any other. For Spaniſh, anſwered <hi>Cleander,</hi> hee ſpeakes it as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as French, and ſo he doth Latine and Italian: But for the doctrine, although he be not ſo ignorant as the moſt part of our French Gentlemen, who (out of an unexcuſable ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſſe) doe take it as a glory to bee ignorant of learning; yet I doe not thinke him capable of treating of this point, whereof this Hermite hath ſo happily acquitted himſelfe. Whileſt they thus diſcourſed, <hi>Lidian</hi> (being the ſame Hermit of whom they ſpake) whom deſpaire (whereinto his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe had driven him as well as <hi>Clarangeus</hi>) had brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Mountaine, comming out of his Pulpet, went into a little Chappell, and kneeled before the Altar: whither <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> together with <hi>Liſander,</hi> and their ſervants following, the better to cleere the ſuſpicion which they had that he was his brother-in-law, after the Hermit had finiſhed his praying, ſaid unto him, Father, wee are here three or foure French ſlaves, who within ſmall time have beene taken captives by the Turkes, and have beene delivered, yet have loſt all that we have; I doe therefore pray, if you preach againe this day or to morrow, to doe us the favour to recommend our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty unto the charitable almes of your well diſpoſed audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Lidian</hi> looking ſtedfaſtly upon him who thus ſpake, and ſeeing <hi>Cleander</hi> cloathed in thoſe ragges, which were no other than a redde Waſt-coate of poore Cotton, a paire of Breeches of courſe cloath, and a blew Cap which hee had in his hand, not being able to imagine that it was his brother-in-law, who was reduced to this fortune, asked him with a troubled countenance, and an unaſſured voice, in what part of France he was borne, how he was taken, and whither he was going when this misfortune happened? Wee are borne in the Ile of France (anſwered <hi>Cleander</hi>) at leaſt I am, &amp; thoſe whom you may ſee in this habite; for this Pilgrim, and thoſe who accompany him, they are of another part: we were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken comming from Italy, whither wee went in queſt of a Knight whom the cruelty of a Lady hath baniſhed out of France. While hee was thus ſpeaking, both hee and <hi>Liſander</hi> had alwayes their eyes fixed upon <hi>Lidian,</hi> who with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7258:44"/>
countenance often changing colour, confeſſing what he could not deny, in embracing him, ſaid, Oh brother you have found him; for how can I hide my name from you, from whom I could never hide my heart? It is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to deſcribe the firſt motions of this meeting; yet after long embracing in ſilence, <hi>Cleander</hi> ſaid, Brother, embrace this Pilgrime, who is alſo of the countrey, and will tell you newes which will bee no leſſe welcome unto you than my comming. The joy wonderfully encreaſed by <hi>Lidians</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Liſander,</hi> who in few words told him, how his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt mortall ſickeneſſe had wrought in him this heavenly vow. In which ſickeneſſe he had been viſited by <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> who had changed the worldly pompe, and his vaine preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Olinda</hi>'s love, into a Capuchins habit; which brought ſo great admiration into <hi>Lidians</hi> mind, that he did not know whether hee ſhould thinke them dreames or truthes. For who would have thought young men ſo ingaged in love, that they thereby had ruined the foundations of an ancient friendſhip, and had beene carried unto ſuch dangerous extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, through ſuch ſmall occaſions; ſhould in one and the ſame time chooſe for their retraict, the one the Cloiſter of ſo auſtere a profeſſion as the Capuchins, and the other the Cells of ſo retired an Hermitage? Who alſo could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, that two friends, whom the Alpes and Perrenian Mountaines had divided by wayes and deſignes ſo diſtant, and contrary one unto the other, ſhould meet in one time, in a place ſo remote from their affaires, and in habits ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from their conditions? But to returne unto our diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Knights, who ſeeing the other Pilgrims aſſemble about them, as curious to know how theſe extraordinary embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings would end, retired themſelves into the Covent, where dining together, after many diſcourſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they reſolved to leave the Hermitage, and Mount Serrat, and the next morning to take their way towards France. After dinner <hi>Lidian</hi> made another Sermon, at the end whereof (praying God to bleſſe the aſſembly, and graciouſly to accept of thoſe vowes which were paid in the Temple) hee tooke leave firſt of the holy Virgin, of the religious Order, and of the holy Mountaines,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7258:44"/>
where hee had ledde a life ſo ſolitary, and ſo ſweet; delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his laſt farewell in ſuch pitifull words, and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of ſo tender an affection, that they pierced the very Rockes, and the walls of this devout houſe. The next morning, together with their people, all three of them began their journey: and becauſe <hi>Liſander</hi> could not leave his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims habite without breaking his vow, <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Lidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> alſo determined to weare theirs untill they were come home; ſo one under the habite of an Hermite, and the other of a Slave, accompanied our Pilgrime, with as much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their returne, as they had ſorrow at their going out. They entred France by Languedock, and by eaſie journyes they came in a month into Burgundy. <hi>Ambriſia</hi> was then at Paris with <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who loved her both for her owne merit, and her brothers ſake, although ſhee knew nothing of their affections. But <hi>Clarangeus</hi> was in the ſame Covent where <hi>Liſander</hi> left him, who together with his companions going one afternoone to ſee him, they found him walking alone in a Garden. Now it was not hard for him to know <hi>Liſander,</hi> becauſe he knew the vow which hee had made in his ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but when he ſaw him accompanied with an Hermite and a Slave, he knew not what to thinke of either, but ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both without knowing of them. Afterwards turning himſelfe unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> I thinke, ſaid he, in a low voice, that in ſteed of amendment by your Pilgrimage, you debauch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and have reduced this young Hermite from the ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life of Mount <hi>Serrat,</hi> to intangle himſelfe againe with the world. It is true, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> but it is upon ſo good occaſion, that there is more merit in the action, than offence. What merit, replied <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> can you finde in cauſing him to breake his vow made unto God, and yeeld himſelfe to the ſervice of his enemies? Vow hee hath made none, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> and ſo broken none; for he hath not taken this habite, but to leave it when the evill influence of a ſtarre (the onely cauſe why hee tooke it) is paſſed over. And of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it cannot be ſaid that I have leſſe than is acquired by recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling of two perſons who were alwayes one, &amp; lately upon a light occaſion divided.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:7258:45"/>You have reaſon (anſwered <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> not imagining of whom he ſpake) for Charitie is recommended unto us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all vertues, and without it all other are unprofitable; For this cauſe are we commanded to leave our offering at the foote of the altar, and reconcile our ſelves unto our brother, and then returne to our offering void of all paſſion. I am well aſſured, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> that you know this better than I doe; but diſpute with this man, whom you will not finde ignorant, and I thinke, it is with a religious man of this houſe, with whom he deſireth to be reconciled. This word comming neere unto <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> made him remember the difference hee formerly had with <hi>Lidian,</hi> and in the inſtant earneſtly beholding him, hee cryed out: O God, how mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous are thy workes! <hi>Lidian</hi> approaching unto him, they embraced, not without ſorrow for their paſt follies, yet min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſuch joy, that it brought ſhew of teares into their eyes. Sir, ſaid <hi>Lidian,</hi> by that love which you beare unto the religion which now you have undertaken, I doe entreat you to pardon thoſe diſpleaſures which I have done you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that the ſorrow which I apprehend doth farre exceede the puniſhment due unto my fault. It is I, ſaid <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> who doe cry you mercy for the griefe which I have fooliſhly raiſed unto you, and if I have received any from you, I am ſo much the more obliged unto you, as unto the cauſe of this celeſtiall happineſſe which I enjoy in this Cloiſter, and it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mee hope for the glorious life which is in heaven. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy therefore (O <hi>Lidian</hi>) your love without feare ever to bee troubled by <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> and ſuffer me to poſſeſſe the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I have in my ſoule, by having none in this world. But this is not all (ſaid <hi>Liſander</hi>) you muſt needs goe with us, not to ſtay, ſeeing you will not, but to helpe us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a Mooriſh Slave, whom wee have in our company, who would willingly be of our religion. <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> who at firſt thought that hee mocked him, was about to tell him, that hee had profited little either by his ſickeneſſe or pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, when intentively beholding <hi>Cleander,</hi> upon whom (ſo buſie he was in embracing <hi>Lidian</hi>) he had not yet ſo much as caſt a looke, and leſſe imagined that hee was there preſent,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7258:45"/>
he fell from his firſt admiration into amazement. It were a new ſtory to relate the words, the imbracings and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments which paſſed betweene them; wherefore I will omit them, and onely ſay, that after the firſt motions of this ſudden joy was over, it was agreed that <hi>Clarangeus</hi> ſhould aske licence of his Superiours to goe ſtay ſome time in the houſe of the Capuchins at Paris, and that they would ſtay for him at Dijon, from thence to go all together to Paris. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting in this reſolution, that very night <hi>Clarangeus</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and obtained of the Fathers, leave to goe to Paris in the company of another of the Order, whom they gave to him for a companion: and having received their benediction, he went the next morning to his friends, who waited for his comming. Thus went theſe foure together, whileſt <hi>Caliſta</hi> in the meane time afflicted with an extreme ſorrow, which daily increaſed in her, through <hi>Cleanders</hi> not returning, and by <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s evill deportments, which by <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s gentleneſſe were now growne inſufferable; neither was <hi>Liſanders</hi> and <hi>Lidians</hi> abſence a ſmall cauſe.</p>
            <p>In this adverſity, beſides the ordinary viſiting of <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Argire,</hi> ſhe was ſeldome without the company of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſia,</hi> and <hi>Otranta</hi> her mother; whoſe preſence would have diverted much of her evill, if it had beene curable by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: yet ſhee ſet a merrier countenance upon it, than the ſadneſſe of her minde would well ſuffer. But diſloyall <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> being come to ſuch a degree of impudency, that ſhee made no ſcruple to admit <hi>Leon</hi> into her chamber after her Miſtreſſe was in bedde, ſo farre wounded <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s patience, that breaking into a moſt juſt choler, ſhe diſcharged her, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her but three dayes warning, either to retire to her friends, or otherwayes to provide for her ſelfe. <hi>Clarinda</hi> growing deſparate at this putting away, knowing that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with her Miſtreſſe ſhee loſt her friend, beſides the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite which it would be, to be turned away upon ſuch an occaſion, which ſhee did beleeve <hi>Caliſta</hi> would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale, determined to prevent her in accuſing her Miſtreſſe for her owne fault; like as falling into one depth haſteneth unto another, ſo ſhee endevoured to cloake her ſinne with a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7258:46"/>
crime, and to weave the baſeſt and treacherouleſt infidelity, that ever came within the compaſſe of any wicked womans heart.</p>
            <p>In this thought weeping, <hi>Berontus</hi> comming unto her, whileſt <hi>Calista</hi> entertained <hi>Otranta</hi> and <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> who knew nothing of <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s act, asked her the cauſe of her teares; and finding that they proceeded from her turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, more curious to know the cauſe thereof, than of her teares, ſaid unto her, <hi>Clarinda,</hi> my ſiſter is moved to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity by ſome great cauſe; I pray thee tell it mee, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I will either reconcile thee againe unto her (if I can) or if I cannot, I will otherwaies work you ſo good conditions, that you ſhall not ſorrow for your departure from her, and this I promiſe upon mine honour; alſo if it bee for a cauſe not fit to bee ſpoken, I ſweare never to utter it to any. Sir, (anſwered <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who knew that <hi>Berontus</hi> envied <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanders</hi> vertue) under the aſſurance of your promiſe, and to diſcharge my conſcience of the treaſon which I have beene conſtrayned to uſe againſt my Lord <hi>Cleander,</hi> in ſerving my Lady <hi>Caliſta,</hi> I will tell you that, which to my great griefe I have concealed untill this time: After that my Lady had heard <hi>Liſanders</hi> plaints which he made for her in the woods of Beauplaine (where I thinke you then were) ſhee ſo farre imprinted his love in her minde, that her heart never tooke reſt, nor I ever ſaw good time about her. From thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Alarum which one night you had at Beauplaine, occaſioned by <hi>Liſander,</hi> whom my Lady had brought into her chamber unknowne unto any body, whatſoever I could ſay to divert her, and with ſo ſmall diſcretion, that hee was very likely to be ſurprized by my Lord. Then mingling this truth for the greater credit of her lies, ſhee told him at large what you have heard of <hi>Liſander,</hi> when hee ſaved himſelfe out of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s chamber: and continuing her diſcourſe, ſhe added that from thence proceeded her Ladies ſadneſſe, and affliction, wherewith ſhe was ſo continually overwhelmed, unceſſantly bewailing <hi>Liſanders</hi> abſence, under the colour of her brothers and husbands. Finally, ſhe told him, that from thence proceeded her diſgrace, becauſe ſhee could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7258:46"/>
nor approve an affection ſo contrarie unto her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſo deteſted by God and man: adding ſo many teares and oaths unto her words, that <hi>Berontus</hi> (who knew the ſubject was both amiable and worthy) was drawne to a beliefe, at the leaſt of part, and wondred that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> was the theefe who would have ſtolne away his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honor; yet reſpecting his ſiſter in law, &amp; withall deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately of late loving <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> by conſequence was obliged to do nothing raſhly againſt <hi>Liſander,</hi> but only deſired to cleer ſo dangerous a ſuſpicion, and never to ſpeake of it but when he could verifie it. Hee judged that theſe lovers would never ſtay in ſo faire a beginning, if <hi>Liſander</hi> were once returned, and that by <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s meanes it would bee eaſie to ſurprize them; or if <hi>Liſander</hi> did never returne, hee reſolved to rake it up in ſilence, and never to trouble his brothers mind or houſe with diſcovering an evill, which could never bee helped: wherefore hee forbad <hi>Clarinda</hi> to ſpeake any word, or to make any ſhew that ſhe had ſpoken of it, promiſing that he would worke her into her Ladies favour and ſervice, upon condition that ſhe would advertiſe him of her actions, and chiefly of <hi>Liſanders</hi> comming. Inſtantly going to <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and taking her apart, ſaid ſo much of <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s fidelity, of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhe bare unto her ſervice, and of her ſorrow to leave her (concealing what had paſt betweene them) that <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s eaſie and pitifull nature, overcome by his prayers, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them both, <hi>Clarinda</hi> was again received into favour, at leaſt into ſervice, &amp; <hi>Caliſta</hi> nouriſhed an enemy in her houſe, who lightened forth ſtrange and miſerable effects in ſmall time after.</p>
            <p>But at that time <hi>Argire</hi> willing to acknowledge her <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidons</hi> faithfull affections, determined to affiance her ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in the preſence of <hi>Otranta, Caliſta, Ambriſia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Olinda,</hi> who were all entreated by her, and onely <hi>Berontus</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> by <hi>Alcidon,</hi> the ſolemnity being deferred untill the returne of their friends. Thus being all together after dinner with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire,</hi> who, as we have ſaid, ſeldom went from <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s houſe, a Page came in and told them, that a man was at the doore who deſired to deliver them ſome newes of <hi>Cleander. Caliſta,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:7258:47"/>
who moſt of all deſired to know them, cryed, I pray thee let him come in: and not having patience enough to ſtay his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, was riſing up to goe meet him, but was prevented; for there entred in a ſtraight young man, with a browne haire, and ſparkling eyes, a ſweet and ſpritely looke, his face being no leſſe excellently compoſed than was his body: His gate, his motion, and his Pilgrims habite made him known unto <hi>Ambriſia</hi> for her brother, ſooner than unto any other, becauſe ſhe had ſeene him put on this habite, and onely of all the company knew the ſecret of his voyage; wherefore ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly riſing up, ſhee caſt her ſelfe with her armes about his necke, before <hi>Caliſta</hi> had leiſure to behold him, ſaying onely, Brother, Brother, is it you? <hi>Caliſta</hi> hearing this name, and beholding this face, which was ſo lively imprinted in her minde, was ready to ſnatch him out of his ſiſters armes, to receive the kiſſes which with an envious eye ſhee ſaw gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from his lippes. But ſhe diſcreetly retayned her ſelfe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſſembly, of all whom he was knowne, unleſſe it were of <hi>Otranta,</hi> who hearing that this was <hi>Liſander,</hi> unto whom ſhe was ſo much obliged, and whom ſhe had ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired to ſee; received him with no leſſe joy than if he had beene her onely ſon <hi>Lidian. Argire, Olinda, Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> for <hi>Ambriſia</hi>'s ſake, entertained him with no leſſe joy for his happy returne, ſo much deſired of all, but onely of <hi>Leon</hi> and <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who feared, in regard of their fooliſh words which they had ſpoken. All this contentment might in ſome meaſure bee expreſt, but <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s can onely bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by thought, who having with great impatience ſuffered all the company to ſalute him, in the end, ſaid unto him; Sir, is it you who was ſaid to bring newes from <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi> Yea, Madam, anſwered hee, for going (upon my reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very out of a ſickeneſſe, whereof it may bee my Siſter hath told you) in this habite to our Lady of Mount Serrat, I met with a Slave, who told me, hee had met him at Rome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from Naples; and that hee had followed him to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorne, where being embarked both for Marcels, they were taken upon the coaſt of Genoa by a Pirat of Argire, who in his carrying them unto Affricke, was by a ſtorme driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gulfe of Barcelon, and there taken by a Galley of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7258:47"/>
who ſet all the ſlaves at liberty. This man is come along in my company all my journey, and can tell you more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, if you pleaſe to ſee him. O God, ſaid <hi>Caliſta,</hi> where is hee? Here hard by (anſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>) and I doe aſſure my ſelfe, that his ſight will bring you contentment. The Slave then appearing at the doore in his Waſt-coate of redde Fryſe, his Breeches of courſe Canvas, and his blew Cap; <hi>Caliſta</hi> would have demanded newes of <hi>Cleander,</hi> but finding that it was hee himſelfe, ſhe for joy (for his unexpected, but moſt welcom comming) fell almoſt in a ſwoune in his armes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus buſied in knowing <hi>Cleander,</hi> and entertaining of <hi>Liſander, Clarangeus</hi> entred into the roome, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knowne by <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> who had ſeene him in that habite before, and went before all the other to ſalute him: <hi>Olinda</hi> was not long after before ſhee knew him, and witneſſed by the change of her colour, the trouble which his preſence brought her. <hi>Caliſta</hi> being hardly come out of her husbands armes to ſuffer others to ſalute him, and going to ſalute <hi>Clarangeus,</hi> whom ſhee had but now ſeene, ſhee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her ſelfe unto <hi>Otranta,</hi> who was talking with <hi>Liſander,</hi> and ſaid unto her, Madam, here wants none now but my Brother to ſatisfie our deſire. You ought, Sir, ſaid ſhee unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> to have brought him backe alſo, aſwell as the other. Madam, ſaid he, it is true that we have found him preaching at our Ladies of Mount Serrat in the habit of a Hermite, and have uſed our beſt endevours to bring him with us; but he told us, that hee would never come backe but by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who baniſhed him: and having heard her ſay that ſhee would witneſſe moſt affection unto him, that ſhould bee moſt obedient unto her, of <hi>Clarangeus</hi> or himſelfe; he was reſolved not to bee the leaſt obedient. Madam, ſaid <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangeus</hi> then unto <hi>Olinda</hi> (who attentively hearkened unto this diſcourſe) it doth now wholly depend on you to give contentment unto this faire company, and to ſatisfie what you owe unto <hi>Lidians</hi> love and your owne promiſe, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him backe againe: You know you promiſed to receive into your favour him of us two, who ſhould come laſt unto you; I am upon this occaſion come firſt, that you may not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7258:48"/>
have any pretence to breake your word with him. I beleeve the time hath been, when you did thinke I would never have ſummoned you to this promiſe, in favour of any other: but thoſe things are the bleſsings which God beſtoweth upon them who doe ſeeke him. It is certaine, Madam, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hee hath made mee reſolve, nothing but hee hath ſweetned the ſorrow I had for your loſſe, and as I left the world becauſe I could not finde any thing which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite my ſtay after this loſſe, ſo having ſequeſtred my ſelfe from it, I have found that reſt and contentment, which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finde before: Live therefore happily with him, ſince that you deſire it; and beleeve, that hee cannot be ſo obliged to your favours due unto his affection, as I am unto your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, by which you have procured unto mee this happy eſtate of life. <hi>Olinda</hi> not knowing what to anſwer unto this ſpeech, and more deſiring <hi>Lidians</hi> returne than they did, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded her; <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſpake in this manner unto <hi>Olinda,</hi> Why deare heart wilt thou confine my brother in thoſe deſerts? wilt thou deprive me of ſo deare company? hath hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any offence worthy of this uſage? And ſhall I (ſaid <hi>Otranta</hi>) having but one Sonne, loſe him for your diſdaine? I pray thee, ſweeteſt faire, be contented that you have made this Knight become a Capuchin, and accept of the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the power of your beauty, without <hi>Lidians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming a Hermite. Alas Madam, anſwered <hi>Olinda,</hi> my greateſt ſorrow is, that he is not here now, that I might wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before this company, how much I honour him: but I doubt not, but the occaſion which made mee ſeparate my ſelfe from him, is remembred by you all, and will ſerve to excuſe me. It is ſufficient, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Olinda</hi> conſenteth to his returne; and if ſhee pleaſe to permit me, I will goe ſeeke, and undertake to bring him back in leſſe time than any one can goe thither. At theſe words <hi>Lidian</hi> making the laſt in the dance entred, eaſing <hi>Liſander</hi> of the paine of ſeeking him, and <hi>Olinda</hi> of the ſhame to ſuffer him. Who can tell you the aſtoniſhment and joy of the company? eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s and <hi>Otranta</hi>'s, which exceeded all expreſsing. He was a longtime in the armes of theſe two laſt, not being
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7258:48"/>

I know not whether he blaſphemed in ſaying ſo, or no; but <hi>Clarangeus</hi> was offended with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and <hi>Olinda</hi> with underſtanding: yet all things being permitted to the amorous, this word was given to <hi>Lidians</hi> paſſion, who was not accuſtomed to preach unto others what hee practiſed: ſo indulgent are we in our owne faults, and ſevere in others. <hi>Olinda</hi> anſwered, that he ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe faults imagined, not done, with ſuch low humility, nor make her bluſh with his ſubmiſsion, which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt fault whereof ſhe could accuſe him.

All that day, and the next night he was in a deep meditation of what ſhould become of him after the combat, if God were ſo mercifull unto him that he were the laſt alive; knowing well, that in reſpect of <hi>Cloridons</hi> favour with the King, hee could have no ſure aboad in France. The next day hee ſtayed in his chamber all the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, expecting every houre when he ſhould be challenged, and therefore cauſed a man to ſtand at the ſtreet doore, to bring him who ſhould be ſent (without any further enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) directly unto him. But when he ſaw noone paſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the whole day without hearing a word, hee did thinke that <hi>Cloridon</hi> was ſatisfied with his reaſons, or was contented in himſelfe that hee had witneſſed his courage in challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That night there was a Cooke, who, amongſt other meane wherewith they were plentifully ſerved, dreſt ſome roſt-meate made with the marrow of Beefe; and in ſtead of chopping of Parſley, which was uſuall, he put in Hemlocke, which was likely to kill all the company, and eſpecially <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> who having had a moſt ſicke night, was conſtrained to be let blood, and take phyſicke the next morning. Hardly had he ſwallowed it, when one came to tell him that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman at the doore deſired to ſpeake with him.

The other (who was a brave Knight called <hi>Chryſantes</hi>) as ſoone as hee came into the chamber, ſeeing the Surgeons ſawcers full of blood upon the table, and the glaſſes wherein the Phyſicke was, empty, was about to returne backe without a word; yet hearing <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> aske who was there, hee entred in: and being ſet downe cloſe by the bedde, every one being commanded away, hee ſaid thus; I came hither, Sir, to have ſpoken with you about a buſineſſe, but now I ſee the ſtate wherein you are, will not permit you to heare of it, wherfore if it pleaſe you, I will hold other diſcourſe, expecting a time when the diſpoſition of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7258:51"/>
your health may better fit both you and mee for the uttering thereof. Pardon mee, ſaid <hi>Liſander,</hi> my ſickeneſſe is not ſo great, that it can let me from hearing, and leſſe from giving you ſatisfaction; I pray therefore forbeare not to deliver your meſſage, for I know already the contents thereof, and if you had come yeſterday, as I did expect, it had beene by this time diſpatcht. Sir, anſwered <hi>Chriſantes,</hi> I could not come yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and I beleeve you cannot goe this day, whither I would have you, without endangering your health: for by the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens which I ſee upon the table, you have beene let blood, and taken Phyſicke this morning. It is true (replied <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) but he who by the conſideration of the danger of his life cannot be retained, will not refraine in conſideration of his health, which is leſſe. You have reaſon, ſaid <hi>Chriſantes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes one may loſe his health without loſing his life, but never his life without his health: yet becauſe in this buſineſſe, the conſervation and loſſe of one dependeth upon another, I would perſwade you to ſtay untill you are in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter health. Sir, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> you cannot be my enemy and counſeller in one and the ſame buſineſſe: I know you come from <hi>Cloridon,</hi> and the notice hee gave mee two dayes ſince of his deſigne, may make him thinke that my indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is rather fained than true; therefore to make him loſe this thought, or to keepe him from having it, tell mee where he is, and I will goe to content him with my arme in a skarfe, and my phyſicke in my belly: for ſeeing he will not receive the ſatisfaction which I would have given him, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have it now. Seeing you are ſo reſolved, replied <hi>Chriſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> I will onely entreat you to take a friend with you, who may witneſſe with me your endevour in this action. I have no friend, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> having too many; for there are many in this houſe, who will not yeeld that point one unto the other: ſo that in ſtead of a particular combate, we ſhould fight a battell, and put you to trouble in finding friends to oppoſe them. But to ſatisfie your deſire which you have, not to be idle, I promiſe you, that if <hi>Cloridon</hi> leave me with life, I will give you ſome exerciſe. Let us goe then Sir, ſaid <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantes,</hi> and not ſuffer him to wait any longer: for hee hath

Doe what you pleaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Liſander,</hi> but diſpatch: Hee then ſet forward towards <hi>Cloridon,</hi> who came towards him; and ſeeing <hi>Liſander</hi> have one arme in a skarfe, hee asked the cauſe. <hi>Chriſantes</hi> in few words told him what had paſt, and ſo retired two or three hundred paces on the one ſide. <hi>Cloridon</hi> then gallopping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Liſander,</hi> who made towards him (wearied with ſo long ſtay) ſpake unto him in this manner: Knight, ſo farre as I can perceive, your indiſpoſition makes me diſpence with you for fighting: wee will therefore, if you pleaſe, deferre it untill your health will better permit it, for this preſent eſtate of yours, can neither be commodious for you, nor honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me. No, no, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> two men of our qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and making, cannot returne out of this medow without fighting: Reſolve therefore to overcome or dye, ſeeing you will not live in friendſhippe with him who hath ſought it at your hands. Go too then, ſaid <hi>Cloridon,</hi> let us prove whether you have done well or no in deſpiſing a courteſie from one, who did thinke to have obliged you thereby. I will neither aske it, nor affoord it to you, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with furiouſly ſpurred one upon another. <hi>Liſander,</hi> who (as we have ſaid) ridde upon a luſty and ſtrong courſer, but ſuch a one, as in regard of his long reſting idle in the ſtable, was not ſo ſteddy a runner as <hi>Cloridons</hi> (which was one of the braveſt and readieſt horſes that ever came out of Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſia) ſpurred lively upon his enemy, intending as he did ſtrike with his ſword, to ſhocke alſo with his horſe; but <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridon</hi> fearing the ſhock, &amp; deſirous to get the crupper of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

into Normandy, whither ſhe was conducted by <hi>Lidian,</hi> and accompanied by <hi>Argire</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> unto Paris.</p>
            <p>Behold, how unto this ſhort pleaſure ſucceeded long ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, teares, and farewels; a pitifull departure: the griefe and words, which were conceived and uttered betwene perſons ſo neare of blood, and ſo knit in affection, goe beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing. <hi>Cleander</hi> remained at Beauplaine with <hi>Caliſta,</hi> in ſo great ſolitarineſſe, that it ſeemed to preſage the miſchiefe which happened. Now muſt I foule my Story with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and lewdeſt accident that ever befell, and I doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre to write this bloody and ſad diſcourſe; but it is not to bee omitted. <hi>Leon</hi> (when <hi>Cleander</hi> withdrew himſelfe unto Beauplaine) remained at Paris, were it that he had particular buſineſſe which held him there, or that they did not ſo much rely upon him as upon the others, he was not intreated to go with them thither: And <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who could not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, ſeeing this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany ſcattered, unwilling to loſe ſo fair an occaſion of ſeeing him, determined to uſe the ſame means w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> her Miſtres formerly did to ſee <hi>Liſander</hi>: but there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firſt a Prodigie, which cannot be told without wonder. <hi>Cleander,</hi> being in this evill humour through the loſſe of ſo good company, was viſited by a Kinſman of his named <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſco,</hi> who ſometimes had been his Tutour, unto whom hee being willing to give all the pleaſure hee could, and thereby endevour to divert himſelfe from this melancholy which did conſume him, hee made a match to goe hunt the wilde Boare; unto which ſport (beſides the domeſticks) he ſent for ſome of his Tenants, who were better acquainted with the waies and layers of the beaſts, commanding them to call him earely in the morning, and beare him company. In this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination having ſupt very earely with <hi>Veraſco,</hi> and left him in his chamber, hee himſelfe went to bedde: it was not day by a great while, when hee heard knocking at the gate of the Caſtle, which awaked him: and remembring what he had commanded his huntſmen over night, he thought they were come to call him unto his ſport; wherefore he called up him who waited in his chamber, commanding to go let them in, while hee made himſelfe ready: The Gentleman went, and

opening the gates, found no body; therefore ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad dreamed that he heard. Hee was no ſooner laid, when they heard againe great knocking at the gate, by the hammer thereof. <hi>Cleander,</hi> who upon the anſwer which was made, that it was not yet day, thought his people were gone backe againe, hearing new, and more violent knocking, thought that day did now appeare, and that they were returned, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſervant to riſe the ſecond time, and goe unto the gate, who finding nobody there, went to lye downe againe. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning began to ſhew the brightneſſe of her beames above the Horizon, when <hi>Cleander</hi> hearing one knocke the third time, roſe himſelfe out of his bedde, and putting on his night-gowne, without calling any of his ſervants, went himſelfe unto the doore, where hee found his Hoſte, whom hee had cauſed to be buried in Italy, who ſaid unto him theſe ſadde words: Good morrow Sir, I come to acquit my promiſe, that you may the better diſcharge your duety to your ſoule: thinke upon death, for within three dayes you ſhall ſuffer it. This ſhape vaniſhing after theſe words, left <hi>Cleander</hi> in that feare which may be imagined; ſo that lying downe by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta,</hi> he told her the fearfull viſion which he had ſeene. <hi>Caliſta</hi> ready to ſwoune at this diſcourſe, yet ſo well as ſhee could hid her aſtoniſhment from <hi>Cleander,</hi> for feare ſhe ſhould adde unto his feare, and like a woman of great ſpirit and courage, comforted him as well as ſhe could, telling him that he ought not to tye his beleefe unto theſe fantaſtick illuſions, although it were well done alwayes to prepare himſelfe to the loſſe of this life, that death might not ſurprize him; and riſing both up, they went to prayers. <hi>Veraſco</hi> alſo roſe ſhortly after, from whom <hi>Cleander</hi> would not hide what hee had told unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta,</hi> whereupon as well by the counſaile of the one, as by the prayers of the other, he altered his determination of hunting, and ſent for a Prieſt to reconcile himſelfe unto God, waiting with a quiet minde what it ſhould pleaſe God to ſend. Theſe three dangerous daies, wherein hee had beene threatned, were ſpent in prayers, faſtings, watchings, and chriſtian me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. <hi>Cleander</hi> feeling no indiſpoſition of body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7258:55"/>
he might apprehend a naturall death, neither did hee ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect any enemy, from whence he ſhould feare a violent one; ſo that the night of the third day being come, ſeemed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Cleanders</hi> life, and to convince his Hoſte of a lye: then did he accuſe himſelfe of weakeneſſe, and blamed his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much credulity, which had over lightly given ſuch an ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum upon the uncertaine report of a ſhadow, being aſhamed that <hi>Veraſco</hi> and <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſhould bee witneſſes of the feare which hee had: and <hi>Caliſta</hi> gave thankes unto God, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vaine ſo evill a preſage, when the curſed <hi>Clarinda</hi> having brought <hi>Leon</hi> into the houſe by the garden gate, whereof we have formerly ſpoken, and having made him enter into <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta</hi>'s chamber, thinking that ſhe would lye with <hi>Cleander,</hi> as ſhe had done ſince this laſt voyage.</p>
            <p>It chanced for all their miſchiefes, that <hi>Caliſta,</hi> wearied with her paſſed watchings, and ſick with the affliction of her precedent feare, whereof ſhe thought her ſelfe now free, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the three dayes expired wherein her husbands life was threatned (after ſhe had born him company untill midnight, together with <hi>Veraſco</hi>) would go unto her owne chamber, to ſleepe alone, and with more quiet. <hi>Clarinda</hi> who had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her night-cloaths into <hi>Cleanders</hi> chamber, hearing her ſay ſo, carried them preſently backe into her Miſtreſſes, from whence ſhee made <hi>Leon</hi> preſently depart, that he might not be ſurprized: But he could not goe downe the ſtaires, becauſe <hi>Veraſco</hi> withdrawing himſelf into a chamber upon the ſide of <hi>Cleanders, Caliſta</hi> going with him, they ſtayed themſelves betweene the two doores; both which opened upon the ſtaires, with ſo much light of divers candles, that hee could hardly hide himſelfe there where he was, neither durſt he go higher for feare of making a noiſe: and being deſirous to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape at any hand, hee no ſooner heard her bid <hi>Veraſco</hi> good night, but he came down againſt the light which was going up into <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s chamber with her ſelfe. The Page who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the candle, frighted to ſee this man come haſtily downe the ſtaires, unknown unto him, with his ſword in his hand, and ſhee alſo cryed out: <hi>Cleander,</hi> who was at his chamber doore, going in, hearing his wife cry, came ſuddenly out, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7258:56"/>
was juſt in <hi>Leons</hi> way, having nothing about him but his night Gowne; yet he ſtept unto him and ſtayed him, and ſo tooke hold of his ſword, that both the one and the other had ſtayed, if <hi>Leon</hi> finding himſelfe taken, and not being able o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to get away, had not ſtabbed him with his dagger, which made him let goe his hold. This wretch <hi>Leon</hi> having deadly wounded him, and by this meanes got cleare of him, was yet happy in this, that he eſcaped by the way which hee entred, &amp; ſaved himſelf, without being followed or known, becauſe that every body ran preſently to <hi>Cleander,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which they did endevour to bring for his life, ſaved his murderer, together that this accident did ſo ſurprize them, that hee was ſooner gotten from <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> than it could be imagined that hee was entred. <hi>Cleander</hi> being carried to his bedde by <hi>Veraſcus,</hi> and his ſervants which were run thither at the noiſe, together with diſcomfited <hi>Calista,</hi> who grew deſperate at this miſchance, having alwaies the ſword which hee had taken from this curſed hand which hurt him; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly upon it, knew that it was his friend <hi>Liſanders,</hi> (you have heard how <hi>Leon</hi> found it, and having amended it in the ſame hilts wherein it was before, wore it in <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> abſence.) <hi>Cleander</hi> judging himſelf dead, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by whom, or how, not being able to comprehend that it was <hi>Liſander,</hi> &amp; not knowing how his ſword ſhould come into any other mans hand, was no leſſe aſtoniſhed to ſee it, than at his owne death: In the end, finding that hee fainted, &amp; having a greater feeling of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s ſorrow than his own, hee tooke her hand, which he wrung, and looking upon her with a firme countenance, in comforting uſed theſe words, <hi>Caliſta,</hi> I ſuffered your teares theſe three laſt daies, in which wee both feared what is now happened, beleeving that they might have prevented this ſtroake, and beene of uſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the time which I had to remaine with you; but now being unprofitable, I cannot ſuffer you vainely to afflict your ſelfe for mee, who finde no other evill in death, but my lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you: for beleeve, the ſeparation between my ſoule and body troubleth mee but little, in compariſon of that from you. But knowing that I cannot poſſeſſe you, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7258:56"/>
of parting from you, that our life is ſo knit unto death, that wee cannot enjoy one without the other. I infinitely comfort and rejoice my ſelfe, that God doth now grant (which I have ever begged of him) that I might not live to ſee thee dye. To this favour he hath added ſo many more, that I ſhould dye in unexcuſable ingratitude, if I did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how uncapable I am worthily to acknowledge them: but there is no bleſſing which I have received, wherein I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my ſelf more happy, or more ſatisfied, than in the ſweet life we have led together, which I may well call a marriage without thornes. I conjure you <hi>Caliſta,</hi> by the deſire which you ought to have to ſweeten the anguiſh and paine of my death, not to encreaſe it by your griefe; but conforme your ſelf to Gods will, who hath done me this favour, to advertiſe me of the time, that I might have leiſure to prepare my ſelfe: In time you ſhall know from whence this ſtroake came, for Gods juſtice will never leave it unpuniſhed before men; yet take ſpecial care that this ſword do not deceive you, for I had rather dye twice more than enter into any diſtruſt of the true Maſter thereof, whom I do entreat you to love above all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons next me, as I did love him next unto you above all things in the world: but good God, ſaid he, how is it poſſible that it ſhould come into the hands of this murderer? with theſe laſt words he fainted, and calling upon the name of Jeſus, he died even upon the breake of day, at the ſame houre where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Spirit appeared, with that diſcomfort unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and ſuch aſtoniſhment unto <hi>Veraſco,</hi> and all the ſervants, that no humane diſcourſe is able to expreſſe it. <hi>Cleander</hi> thus dead, and <hi>Caliſta</hi> extremely ſicke, and overwhelmed with inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable griefe, <hi>Veraſco,</hi> who was a grave wiſe man, not being able to call again his life, reſolved to revenge his death, and to find the ſpring from whence it came. The dead man had no neerer kinſman than <hi>Berontus,</hi> who was then abſent; wherefore <hi>Veraſco</hi> was obliged to procure juſtice upon the crime: firſt hee began to informe himſelfe which way this man came into <hi>Beauplaine,</hi> and hee found that it was by the garden gate, whereof wee have ſpoken, which of neceſſity

muſt ſome of the houſe open; for ſince the alarum, when <hi>Cleander</hi> tooke <hi>Liſanders</hi> comming in the night for theeves, hee had beene carefull to keepe it ſhut: this evening it had ſo rained, that the prints or markes of ſhooes did plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the alleyes, where was manifeſtly ſeene that there were two prints of different bigneſſe, from whence hee col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that one had opened the gate for the other. <hi>Veraſco</hi> perceiving this, cauſed all the ſervants of the houſe to come into that alley, whoſe feet hee meaſuring with the prints which were made in the ſand, there was none found any way agreeing, but onely <hi>Clarinda</hi>'s, whoſe ſhooe did perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit the leſſer print, which ſerved as a great proofe, at the leaſt for a violent ſuſpicion againſt her; who (otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed and convinced by her owne conſcience) did not deny the fact: But alas, it had beene much better that ſhe had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed this truth, than to have added ſo execrable and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a lye; For it is very true (ſhee ſaid) it was I who ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the gate, notwithſtanding it was by my Miſtreſſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Veraſco</hi> not willing to proceed further in examination of a cauſe ſo criminall, made <hi>Clarinda</hi> faſt, and ſent for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſtrictly forbidding every body to ſpeake of it unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who was ſo plunged in ſorrow, and drowned in griefe, that her ſickeneſſe moved no leſſe pity than <hi>Cleanders</hi> death. The Judges, who for the moſt part are like Surgeons, ſeeking for nothing more than for wounds and ſwellings, quickly came unto the place, viſited the body, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Clarinda,</hi> who perſevering in what ſhee had formerly ſaid, added, that <hi>Liſander</hi> was the man who had killed her Maſter, as might eaſily bee ſeene by the ſword which hee had left; that ſhe had let him into the houſe by <hi>Calista</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as formerly ſhee had done, although to her extreme ſorrow, which ſhe no longer able to beare, had diſcovered to <hi>Berontus,</hi> whom ſhe called to witneſſe theſe words. <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta</hi> being upon this accuſation heard, for the fulneſſe of her misfortune, ſaw her ſelfe accuſed of her husbands death, by her who was the cauſe thereof, and for her laſt calamitie

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7258:59"/>
ſtirring pity in that place, where it never had beene: O <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> where art thou! what are become of all thy pleaſant dayes? unto what is all thy glory and vanity reduced? O <hi>Cleander,</hi> my onely joy and comfort, was it not affliction e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to loſe thee, without being accuſed for thy loſſe? Ah <hi>Liſander,</hi> the ſervices which you have done mee heretofore are now dearly ſold unto me, and I pay thoſe honeſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of your love, with a high price. O <hi>Liſander,</hi> why doeſt not thou know of my impriſonment? And you my Judges, why doe you not know mine innocency? And thou <hi>Clarinda,</hi> why doſt thou accuſe mee? In the middeſt of theſe complaints (much more grievous than I can expreſſe) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comforted her but the hope of death, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for her; which ſhee would have much more deſired than her liberty, if ſhe could have received it without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring infamy for the crime whereof ſhe was accuſed: But not to be long upon ſo grievous a ſubject, I will briefly ſay, that <hi>Berontus</hi> being come from Burgundy, and (being no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed than ſorry for thoſe accidents ſince his departure) was heard by the Provoſt, and confronted with <hi>Clarinda,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe former ſpeeches, his being conformable, it ſeemed that <hi>Calista</hi> was ſufficiently attainted and convicted of her husbands death, ſo that her proceſſe was (in the worlds opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) judged both to the loſſe of her life and honour. I muſt not forget the griefe which this misfortune brought unto <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, Alcidon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Argire,</hi> who were then at Paris; the ſorrow which <hi>Ambriſia</hi> had, who was in Burgundy, and that which was ſuffered by <hi>Lidian</hi> and his Parents in Normandy, when they knew of it. <hi>Argire</hi> and <hi>Olinda</hi> imployed all their friends to ſpeake with <hi>Caliſta,</hi> but were not able to obtaine it. All the world wondred that <hi>Liſander</hi> had ſo fouled the glory of ſo many brave deeds, by ſo diſhonourable an act. There was none but <hi>Cloridons</hi> friends, who (beleeving that hee was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly murdered) rejoiced that hee had committed this laſt baſe act, as a proofe of the former. <hi>Liſander</hi> was then at Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, farre from thinking upon ſuch an act, where a faithfull Poſte, whom <hi>Alcidon</hi> had ſent, let him underſtand the newes of this deplorable diſaſter. When he heard of <hi>Cleanders</hi> death,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7258:59"/>
he uttered great ſorrow, as for a perſon whom next unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta,</hi> he truely loved above all creatures; but when he knew that the common beliefe was that he had killed him with his wifes privity, who was for that cauſe a priſoner, and upon the point of her puniſhment, he was ſtrooke with ſilence, the newes taking from him both his feeling, and all his ſenſes, like a great ſtroake which is not felt at the inſtant, but ſome time after it is received. When he had gathered his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits unto him, which were wandred away with the violence of the firſt motion, and that griefe had given place unto his words; O God, what did he not ſay! his griefe cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, but by that of <hi>Caliſta</hi>; for never two ſoules were ſo equally wounded with one ſtroak, and their wounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like unto all others, had nothing to paralell either the others, but themſelves: yet being a man, and having his liberty, he did reſolve to loſe it together with his life, or elſe to aſſure <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s. Now if hee durſt appeare, he had done his Lady a great ſervice, for his flight was one maine argument againſt her, and his preſence would have much ſerved for their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. But <hi>Cloridons</hi> murder being freſh, and his blood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt warme, repreſenting it ſelfe every day to the Kings me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, who would never grant him his pardon, he thought that his preſence, in ſtead of ſatisfying things, would exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, and that unprofitably he ſhould carry his head to bee loſt at Paris, without ſaving <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s: but what cannot love doe in a gentle heart? hee reſolved to goe thither, and ſo taking Poſt with the ſame Meſſenger, which was ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he came in the night unto <hi>Alcidons,</hi> truſting both his honour and life into his hands, although being of <hi>Cleanders</hi> friends, he had cauſe to have feared (if he had beene guilty.) Having conferred with <hi>Alcidon, Argire,</hi> and <hi>Olinda,</hi> whom he alſo ſaw, and having told them how he left his ſword in the field, and tooke <hi>Cloridons</hi> which hee ſtill wore, they all rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the appearance of his innocency: Hee asked them, if they had not ſeen <hi>Calista</hi> in priſon, and they telling him, how farre they had endevoured, and how little they had effected; he ſaid, he had thought to intreat <hi>Clarangeus</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to goe thither, who through the reverence of his habit, might have the more

As they were upon theſe termes, one came to tell <hi>Alcidon,</hi> that <hi>Berontus</hi> was at the gate, who had not ſeene <hi>Alcidon</hi> ſince his comming from <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which was ſome two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; that time he had ſpent in viſiting <hi>Veraſco,</hi> the Judges, and <hi>Clarinda,</hi> whom he did confront. <hi>Alcidon</hi> was not of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that he ſhould ſee <hi>Liſander</hi>; wherefore leaving him in the chamber with <hi>Olinda,</hi> he with <hi>Argire</hi> ledde <hi>Berontus</hi> into another: They found him much afflicted, as he who did not alone bewaile <hi>Cleanders</hi> misfortune, but <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s and <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> alſo, for <hi>Ambriſia</hi>'s ſake; ſo that their firſt embracing was mingled with teares, which being over, <hi>Berontus</hi> could not forbeare, ſaying, Well Sir, would you ever have thought that ſo brave a Knight as <hi>Liſander,</hi> and ſo honeſt a Lady as <hi>Caliſta,</hi> ſhould have agreed together in committing ſo baſe a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, the one againſt his friend, the other againſt her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?

She, who was a woman, and more, of Paris, and beyond, of that common ſort which will give themſelves unto the Devill for money, hearing him ſpeake of a hundred crownes in ready money, and a promiſe to have more for lending her chamber two dayes, in receiving the crownes, ſaid unto him, Jeſus Sir, this coſt need not, the houſe is at your command, and I hope alſo you have not much failed, for this barred window<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which you ſee a little higher than ours, is one of the beſt chambers in the Caſtle, and where they are accuſtomed to lodge their priſoners of the beſt quality, ſo that I am much deceived if this Lady whereof you ſpake, doth not lodge there: and with this gracious ſpeech, ſhe brought him into the chamber, which was a beaſtly one.</p>
            <p>The husband, who ſaw a Courtier (as hee thought) goe ſo early into his houſe with his wife, being not uſed to ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, rudely asked of him what hee came for into his houſe.

Although <hi>Liſander</hi> was vexed, yet could he not forbeare laughing at this Butchers ſpeech, who was a true Pariſian: ſo thanking him for his honeſt courteſie, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to lend him an inkehorne and paper, which was preſently brought him, and having written a ſhort letter, he tyed it, with pen and inkehorne of the leaſt ſize he could get, to caſt it into the window thorow the barres thereof, which being double, made the entrance very difficult.

danger of being taken) run a great hazzard of being known.

By whom (anſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>)? there is no man in the world in whom I would rely, but in your ſelfe, and there is no leſſe danger for you than for my ſelfe: for if it be known that you meddle either in <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s buſineſſe or mine, you loſe <hi>Berontus</hi> his love (whereof we have now need) the Kings favour, and I my retiring place, together with the aſſiſtance of all my friends, who cannot openly helpe in a buſineſſe ſo perillous. But how will you now doe to have newes from <hi>Caliſta</hi> (ſaid <hi>Alcidon</hi>)? for to fight againſt the Serjeants at the barre again, is a manifeſt ruine, and belongs onely to a mad-man to be ſo deſperate.

You muſt then (replied <hi>Alcidon</hi>) do two things more: The one, that I may follow you a great way off on horſebacke to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any miſchiefe that might happen, if you were known, or if any accident ſhould happen like this firſt: The other is, that you take money to give unto the Porter, for if you ſpeak in any other language, hee will as little underſtand you, as if you ſpake Greeke, and if he can, will apprehend you. I have (anſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>) yet five hundred Crownes in gold left, wherewith I hope ſo to dazell his eyes, before I doe prepare him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhake his fidelity. There muſt yet another thing be done, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> which is, that in writing to <hi>Caliſta,</hi> you adviſe her to ſdipoſe the Gaoler who bringeth her meat, to hearken unto one who ſhould ſpeake with him from her, and that ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him, and give him what ſhee pleaſe; for it ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: and ſhe may much better negotiate this buſineſſe in the chamber, than you in the open ſtreet, with the danger of your life, together alſo that ſhe hath ſuch meanes to practiſe the good will of men, that he muſt be a Devill if he can deny her. This reſolution taken, they went to dinner with <hi>Argire</hi> and <hi>Olinda</hi> (who were there together) it being paſt one of the clocke, and yet had neither eat nor drunke.</p>
            <p>It was a little before the feaſt of Chriſtmas, after which time <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s proceſſe was to bee judged: neither was there any meanes to hinder her condemnation, according to her Councels opinion, but in juſtifying <hi>Liſander,</hi> who durſt not preſent himſelfe for the reaſons aboveſaid, ſo that every one did with ſeverall paſſions expect this faire Ladies pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke execution, and ſhee her ſelfe was not ignorant thereof, being courageouſly reſolved. All theſe things concurring in <hi>Liſanders</hi> memory, preſſed him in ſuch manner, that hardly had he patience to dine, much leſſe to ſtay untill night for the executing of his deſigne; wherefore having put on the moſt tottered beggars weed that he could finde, and being ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed that hee was unknowne unto his friends, before hee went out of the houſe, he wrote the letter which hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to fling unto <hi>Caliſta</hi>; and accompanied with <hi>Alcidon</hi> and two ſtout footmen that followed afarre off, he went againe into that narrow ſtreet by the Caſtle, not without feare of ſome miſadventure, as well in regard of what hapned in the morning, as becauſe he was to enterpriſe without a ſword, or any other armes, but onely a poniard which he had under his weeds: when he had paſt the Caſtle, leaving the barre of Sergeants on the left hand, he entred into the Butchers ſtreet upon the righthand, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> walking up and downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the little bridge and S. <hi>James</hi> ſtreet; he went directly into the houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he had formerly written unto <hi>Calist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She then beleeving hee was one of thoſe who ſould counterfeit chaines, &amp; would deceive her, in ſhaking her head, ſaid unto him, No friend, you miſtake me, get you gone, or I will—But let us ſee, ſure hee hath ſome chaine to ſell: Saying this, ſhee came neere unto the doore, looking more upon <hi>Liſanders</hi> hands than upon his face, who then ſaid unto her; Madam, I am the Gentleman who came this morning unto you, having thus diſguiſed my ſelfe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of an accident which hapned at my going from hence: I pray ſay nothing, for you will get nothing by my hurt, and may hope for much profit by my proſperity, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in comforting this poore priſoner. This woman hardly knowing him, ſaid, Jeſus Sir, and my good Maſter, who would have knowne you in theſe cloaths? how could you get away from their hands? how durſt you come againe? enter quickly for feare you ſhould be knowne, for I tremble ſtill for love of you.

               <hi>Caliſta</hi> having received this ſecond Letter, and upon <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> deſigne had already taſted the Porter, whom ſhe found not altogether averſe from her purpoſe, although ſhe had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered nothing in particular, nor he promiſed any thing but in generall termes, only ſhe had proceeded ſo far, that ſhe might have ſome hope from his mercenary and barbarous minde, whom ſhe had with gifts and faire words ſo ſoftened, that contrary unto his cruell and ſtony diſpoſition, he had witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſorrow for her misfortune, and a deſire to helpe her; which ſhe preſently writ unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> who with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible joy conceived ſome good hope of this enterpriſe: but as he retired himſelfe with this Letter, alwayes accoſted with <hi>Alcidon</hi> and his footmen, who never loſt ſight of him, being gotten from under the Caſtle, and in his opinion free from danger, he met a Marſhall with many Archers, who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as priſoners all that were poore, and begged in the ſtreet, becauſe it being (as we have ſaid) a little before the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7258:65"/>
feaſt of Chriſtmas, in which beggars are very importunate, they were taken and ſhut up in a place, where they were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the money which was put into the poore mens Boxe in Churches, and a ſtraight command was given, that none ſhould begge upon paine of whipping, and that none ſhould give upon paine of Fines. Theſe men meeting with <hi>Liſander</hi> at the end of our Ladies Bridge, and taking him not for ſuch as he was, but for ſuch as hee ſeemed to be, would have had him to priſon; but he, who would not goe with them, ſo ſhooke off the Marſhall and his Archers, that he made them leave him at liberty: hee being aſsiſted by <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> footmen, who came as if they would know what the matter was, and <hi>Alcidon</hi> himſelfe riding among them with his horſe to know the newes; ſo that <hi>Liſander</hi> (by whoſe apprehenſion the Marſhals men thought nothing was to be gained) got unto his lodging without any further trouble, where having left his beggars weeds, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into his owne habite, hee ſhewed the laſt letter which <hi>Caliſta</hi> had flung out, and told not onely what had happened unto him with the Marſhall; but alſo with the Butchers wife, which <hi>Alcidon</hi> knew not. It being now night, they went to ſupper with the faire Ladies (who did ordinarily beare them company) reſolving after ſupper to goe on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe about ten of the clocke to the Caſtle, ſo ſtrong, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Porter ſhould goe about to betray them, they would be able rather to revenge themſelves upon him, than be taken. While they were talking with <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Argire,</hi> (who continually prayed to God for the deliverance of their companion, beleeving that if ſhe were once at liberty, and <hi>Liſander</hi> out of <hi>Cloridons</hi> buſineſſe, both of them would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifie themſelves) <hi>Caliſta</hi> was with the Gaoler and his wife, who attended upon her, and having given them jewels which ſhee had about her, to the value of foure or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownes, ſhee ſaid unto them, that it was not for the ſervice which ſhe hoped to receive, that ſhee gave them this, but for that which they had already done; for if God be ſo mercifull unto me, ſaid ſhe, that I may verifie my innocency, it is the leaſt good which you ſhall hope for from my libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7258:66"/>
but if it pleaſe God to diſpoſe otherwiſe of me, this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at the leaſt ſhall remaine with you, that you may pray for me, &amp; cheriſh the memory of one, who is extremely grieved that ſhe cannot binde you further. In ſaying this <hi>Caliſta</hi> wept, and by her words and teares raiſed ſuch pity in their hearts, beſides that which the preſent gifts (which as the Spaniſh proverb ſaith, breaketh downe rockes) and the hope to have more, wrought, that they themſelves prevented the requeſt which ſhee would have made unto them, and encouraged her to ſave her ſelfe, offering their perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their lives to ſerve her: the Porter offering further to deliver her, ſo that ſhee had any truſty friend who would convey her out of the City, after he had delivered her out of the priſon. <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who ſaw ſhe had touched them, and perceived plainly that it was not counted it to betray her, added unto her former ſtroaks, ſaying, My friends, although you ſhould loſe the miſerable gaine, which you ſo wretchedly, and with ſo much pain get here, by ſetting me at liberty: yet you ſhould have no cauſe to complaine, for, beſides that which you may hope for &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe yours ſelves from me, I have a friend who will give you this very night five hundred Crownes, if you will, &amp; at your delivering me into his hands, will give you a thouſand more: and be not affraid that hee will deceive you, for you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it all before you deliver me; but withall take heed you doe not deceive him, for if you ſhould doe ſo, no place in the world would aſſure your lives: and you ſhould bee moſt wicked (which I will never beleeve of you) if you ſhould procure hurt unto them, who intend ſo much good unto you, for, by doing this good work, and binding ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as have intereſt in me, by this act, in one day without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or running any danger, you may raiſe a fortune worthy of your ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and live honourably either with us, or elſe where you pleaſe, all the reſt of your lives, without being conſtrained to practiſe this courſe of life, in my opinion too baſe for your hearts: With theſe words and many others, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi> being aſſured of the Porter, and drawing from him the ſtrongeſt oaths he could give, ſhe ſhewed him <hi>Liſanders</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereupon it was concluded that he ſhould goe out that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7258:66"/>
night about ten of the clocke, to receive the five hundred Crownes, and agree upon a day for her deliverance.</p>
            <p>As they had agreed, it was done; the Porter going about ten of the clock without the barre of the gate, ſaw two men, who walking up and downe on horſeback, ſome twenty or thirty paces from the gate, one of them, who was <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſeeing him without the bar, left his companion (who was <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidon,</hi> with two footmen who followed him) and going un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, asked him if hee were not the man which carried meat unto the Lady who was priſoner there. Yes, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he. Hath not ſhe advertiſed you, replied <hi>Liſander,</hi> that I would be here at this time about her buſineſs? She hath told mee (anſwered the Porter) that a Gentleman would about this time come hither to ſpeake with me, but I doe not know that it is you. <hi>Liſander</hi> hereby knowing that <hi>Caliſta</hi> had made the bargaine, ſaid, hold friend, here is five hundred Crownes in gold in this purſe, which I give for a token that it is I, and if thou canſt deliver her to me to morrow, I will give thee a thouſand more, which ſhee hath promiſed unto thee, before thou put her into my hands: But do not think to deceive me, for if thou doeſt, I vow to kill thee, though I fall into all the hangmens hands in France. Sir, ſaid the Porter, (taking the Crownes) I will not deceive you, but I cannot promiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver her before the feaſt of Kings. How (anſwered <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi>) what if the proceſſe ſhould be judged between this and that? Sir, ſaid the Porter, I will doe what I can to deliver her ſooner; but to aſſure you that I can infallibly doe it before that time, I will not. Thou doeſt promiſe, ſaid <hi>Liſander,</hi> to bring her then hither into this place in the night before that day at the furtheſt. Yes Sir, ſaid the Porter, I do promiſe you to bring her hither about ten of the clock at night, upon pain of my life; and untill that time let mee heare no newes from you, nor expect any from mee, for feare we ſhould be taken ſpeaking together. Tell my Lady then (anſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>) what we have agreed upon, and ſo farewell. In ſaying this, hee turned towards <hi>Alcidon,</hi> and both together w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unto their lodging, where they told unto <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Argire</hi> what
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7258:67"/>
they had done, who received an unſpeakable contentment to ſee <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s deliverance proceed ſo well, although the length of the time bred ſome griefe, &amp; made them fear ſome croſſe: But leſt the proceſſe in the mean time might be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they concluded that <hi>Olinda,</hi> who was betrothed unto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, Caliſta</hi>'s brother, and might openly declare her ſelfe for her ſiſter in law, ſhould goe and intreat the Reporter not to report her proceſſe, untill the comming of her Parents, leſt the innocency of this Lady might run ſome danger for want of a defence: foraſmuch as ſhe was ſo afflicted with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death, and with ſeeing her ſelfe accuſed, that ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more than to bee quickly out of this world, which was the cauſe (as indeed it was) that ſhee had not thought upon any juſtification, nor any perſon for her; but her friends being come, they might peradventure bring <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> who being heard, would wonderfully cleer <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s right. Theſe words full of conſideration and weight, with the credit and grace of the Speaker, had ſo much power over the Reporter, that hee promiſed to ſtay the comming of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi>'s friends, untill the feaſt of Kings were paſt, and rather go into the Countrey with the Proceſſe, than be conſtrained to deliver it into the Court. Thus the feaſt paſſed happily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe foure perſons, <hi>Liſander</hi> never ſtirring abroad, but once under his beggars weeds, to let <hi>Caliſta</hi> underſtand what <hi>Olinda</hi> had done for her, and to know from her alſo whether the Porter had faithfully told her what was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be done the night before the feaſt of Kings, whereof being ſatisfied, hee expected the Eve of the feaſt of Kings with great longing. In the meane time <hi>Berontus</hi> knowing that <hi>Olinda</hi> had ſolicited for the deferring of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, went upon that occaſion to viſit her, made offer to joyne with her in her requeſt, deſiring not only a delay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s freedome; ſo that hee who was guilty of his brothers death might appeare: And although <hi>Olinda</hi> was in a faire way of agreeing them, and that <hi>Berontus</hi> for <hi>Ambriſia</hi>'s love did deſire it; yet <hi>Caliſta</hi> was ſo farre in the hands of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that it was not thought poſſible to get her out by any
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7258:67"/>
agreement. When the Eve of the feaſt of Kings was come, the Maſter Gaoler of the priſon intended to make merry (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ancient cuſtome) with his wife and her friends, the chiefeſt of whom was the Regiſter, and the Hangman his Goſſip; they were to chooſe a King by a beane, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fall to drinking: for this cauſe the Porter had made choice of this night, as fitteſt for this purpoſe, well knowing that ſleep doth ordinarily follow drunkenneſſe: <hi>Caliſta</hi> and <hi>Liſander</hi> were advertiſed to bee ready, the one to goe out of the Caſtle, the other to bee out in the ſtreet about eleven of the clocke (as it was agreed) with this charge, that if they loſt this opportunity, they muſt hope for no other, nor yet think to prolong <hi>Calista</hi>'s judgement any longer, which muſt needs bee both mortall and infamous. <hi>Liſander</hi> came about ten of the clock with <hi>Alcidon</hi> and foure other Gentlemen, every one armed with Piſtols, and well mounted to prevent all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and rather to kill all the Provoſts and Archers of Paris, than ſuffer themſelves to be taken. The Porter had received the thouſand Crownes which were promiſed, and <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta</hi> did impatiently wait for the clockes ſtriking ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which in the end ſtrucke, yet in vaine both for the one and the other: when <hi>Liſander</hi> heard the clocke ſtrike ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and could not ſee his man, he thought that hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, yet long hee was not of this opinion before the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeared; but when <hi>Liſander</hi> ſaw him come alone, hee was about to have killed him, verily beleeving that hee would breake his promiſe: nevertheleſſe he forbore, deſiring to heare what he would ſay, which was, that having heard the clocke ſtrike eleven, and not being able to execute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, he came now to intreat him to have patience, and not thinke much at his waiting, for if his Maſter were aſleepe, who was not yet retired into his chamber, hee would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faile deliver the priſoner. This comforted <hi>Liſander,</hi> but not <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who having expected eleven with ſo much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and told it with ſo much earneſtneſſe, when ſhee ſaw it paſſe without hearing any body, ſhee accounted her ſelfe loſt, and confirmed her ſelfe in that opinion, becauſe the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7258:68"/>
Porter had no meanes to come into her chamber, to give her that advertiſement which hee had done unto <hi>Liſander;</hi> yet there remained ſome weake hope which flattered her griefe while the clock ſtruck twelve, but that being ſtruck, ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſpaired of her liberty, and conſequently of her life.</p>
            <p>In this agony more deadly than death it ſelfe, came the Porter (when ſhe had loſt all hope) who opening the doore of her chamber (a thing ſo far from her thought &amp; expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at an houre when all things elſe ſlept) troubled ſo much her minde with his unexpected comming, and with the firſt motions of a ſudden joy, from an extremity of the contrary paſſion, that in ſtead of going out (as they had projected) ſhe fell down upon the floore in a ſwound. The Porter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely aſtoniſhed, and running unto her, ſaid, Madam, will you undoe mee, who have had a deſire to ſave you? ſake courage, riſe up, and ſee your friends who are here hard by waiting for you. Yet at theſe words <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſtirred not: the Porter was made, his wife, who was appointed to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Caliſta,</hi> was deſperate, all was in diſorder and confuſion: if <hi>Caliſta</hi> had not come to her ſelfe again, who ſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which ſhee did run by her ſtay, with a lively apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her infamy and puniſhment, roſe up, &amp; inſtantly went out of the chamber, to the Porters infinite contentment and his wives: But as ſhe was haſtily going down the ſtairs, which were an ill-favoured paire of ſtone, her feet light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an old Cauldron of braſſe (wherein they did uſe to put fire in cold weather) which tumbling downe from the top unto the bottome, made ſuch a noiſe that all had been ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if (by great good fortune for them) the Gaoler and all his friends had not beene ſo buried in wine and ſleepe, that they would not have heard a Petar. <hi>Caliſta</hi> thus went out of the Caſtle with the woman who tended her, and the Porter, leaving the gates open, and with no leſſe feare than joy came into the ſtreet, where ſhe gave her ſelfe into <hi>Liſanders</hi> armes and <hi>Alcidons,</hi> who received her with an incomparable joy; and having placed her in a Caroch (with the woman who alwaies after remained with her) they retired themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7258:68"/>
               <hi>Alcidons,</hi> bidding the Porter firſt farewell, who was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to retire himſelfe into ſome other place. To tell you <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanders</hi> joy, <hi>Alcidons</hi> pleaſure, the thankes which <hi>Caliſta</hi> gave them, the words, the teares, the kiſſes and embracings which afterwards paſt between <hi>Olinda, Argire</hi> and ſhee, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done: Onely, having ſpent the beſt part of the night, they went towards morning to reſt and ſleep, after ſo many dangerous ſtormes, and ſo many ſorrowes; where I will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to remaine in peace, as unwilling to trouble their reſt, untill we come to the eighth part of this Hiſtory, where with more contentment we ſhall ſee her innocency verified, whoſe impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment and liberty we have already ſeene.</p>

And whereas ſhee had thought, that being once out of the Caſtle, ſhe had been free from all care, more than to juſtifie her ſelfe with time, ſhee then ſaw herſelfe wrapped among difficulties and griefes, which gave little place unto the former.

But were it that hee would doe it himſelfe with more courage and knowledge, or that he did thinke <hi>Caliſta</hi> innocent, he was in his heart very glad that ſhee had made an eſcape: But contrariwiſe <hi>Veraſco</hi> made earneſt requeſt, that hee might bee ſuffered to ſearch <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>'s houſe; who ſoliciting for her, ſeemed to have been the onely cauſe of her eſcaping from the puniſhment of her crime.</p>

unto <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s parents, the ſmall account which they had made of her life, beleeving her guilty of <hi>Cleanders</hi> death, did ſufficiently witneſſe that they would not receive her; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could ſhe have beene more aſſured there than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, for the King doth force obedience all over his Kingdome, which <hi>Liſander</hi> ſwore rather to dye than ſuffer: ſo that <hi>Caliſta</hi> muſt reſolve not alone to leave ſuch deare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, unto whom, beſides her ancient affection, ſhee was newly ſo much bound, but her native country France, where ſhee had beene ſo tenderly brought up, and take upon her a flight into a ſtrange countrey, from all her acquaintance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of a man, unto whom in effect ſhe was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for her life and her honour, but who in appearance, and in the opinion of the world, had beene the ruine of them both, together with the loſſe of her husbands life: judge if <hi>Calista,</hi> a woman of a vertuous and noble carriage, could be ſenſible of this. <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Argire</hi> had no leſſe feeling than ſhe her ſelfe, yet the bitterneſſe muſt be digeſted. <hi>Caliſta</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to depart in the beginning of the night with <hi>Liſander,</hi> his faithfull footman, who was come from Flanders du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the feaſt, and this woman who waited upon her in priſon, with a Gentlewoman whom <hi>Olinda</hi> offered unto her. <hi>Alcidon</hi> made proviſion of ſixe good Horſes in a Coach, to the end that during the long night (alwayes at this time of the yeere) they might make a great journey; and <hi>Olinda</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired her ſelfe unto her owne houſe, expecting the ſearch whereof <hi>Berontus</hi> had advertiſed her, which (nevertheleſſe) was afterwards hindred by himſelfe: ſo that this whole day was paſt with much feare, care, and teares, and as much griefe for <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s departure, as joy for her deliverance. In the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Olinda</hi> being come from her lodging, they ſupped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great ſadneſſe: after followed ſuch pitifull adieues, that I will not by relating them afflict the reader of this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſorrow having ordinarily this contagious quality, that wee cannot ſee it in others, without feeling it in our ſelves. After the laſt embracings, upon this ſeparation, <hi>Caliſta</hi> and her woman entred alone into the Coach, about eight of the clocke at night, and going out of Paris by S. <hi>Denis</hi> gate, ſhee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7258:71"/>
tooke her way towards Flanders through Picardy, followed on horſebacke by <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who (with the ſame Gentlemen who had aſſiſted him the night before) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him beyond <hi>Seutlis,</hi> where he tooke his leave of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta</hi> and <hi>Liſander,</hi> with more hearts griefe unto all three than can be ſpoken; and there leaving the two Gentlemen, hee tooke his way backe to Paris in poſte, fearing that if his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould be knowne, hee might be ſuſpected to have bin of the party. <hi>Caliſta</hi> and <hi>Liſander</hi> after their departure from <hi>Alcidon,</hi> uſed all the diligence poſſible they could untill they had gotten into Cambray, where having reſted themſelves two dayes, they tooke their way to Bruxels with more eaſe and leiſure, <hi>Liſander</hi> entring into the Coach with her, and cauſing his horſe to bee ledde by. But they were no ſooner out from the ſtroaks of Fortune wherewith they had bin ſo beaten, when <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s beauty wiping away in <hi>Liſanders</hi> mind the remembrance of former ſorrowes, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of thoſe which might come, renewed the cruell flames of love: nevertheleſſe conſidering the pitifull aſhes of his friend, <hi>Caliſta's</hi> preſent eſtate, hardly recovered from the aſtoniſhment of ſo many bloody diſaſters, whereof his love had in part beene the occaſion, and his owne miſerable condition, who by his former unhappineſſe, was fallen into diſgrace with his Prince, and into the evill opinion of all France, he thought although it were by anothers fault, yet his love had done injury unto <hi>Cleanders</hi> friendſhip, and unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi>'s chaſtity, to whom as yet he durſt not touch upon that ſtring. Being come unto Bruxels, the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> (who knew <hi>Liſanders</hi> valour, both by the report of what he had done in France, and what hee had done for the Hollanders againſt himſelfe) having welcommed him according to his worth, and ſhewed him extraordinary favour, which hee did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to few, made him offer of two thouſand crownes penſion by the yeere, to draw him to his ſervice, which <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> would not accept, humbly entreating his Highneſſe to pardon him, if he could not be penſionary unto any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his King, with whom although he were now in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, rather by his misfortune than through his fault, yet he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7258:71"/>
would not commit this errour, to take pay of any man but of him: nevertheleſſe humbly thanking his Highneſs, whoſe moſt obedient ſervant he would remain all his life without wages. And although in this <hi>Liſander</hi> performed the duty of a brave and generous Knight (as he was) yet hee had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to repent himſelfe ſhortly after, though in the end it fell out happily for him, as we ſhall ſee in the progreſſe of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Caliſta,</hi> ſo ſoon as ſhe knew the name of the French Embaſſadors wife, with whom ſhe had beene acquainted at Paris, ſhee went (with <hi>Liſanders</hi> conſent) to lye at her lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thereby hoping to avoide the ſcandall of lying at his chamber. And as nothing is impregnable to her graces, ſhee drew the Embaſſadors wife ſo much to her friendſhip, that ſhee was afterwards very profitable unto her: for the King (being advertiſed that they were both retired unto Bruxels, and humbly entreated as well by <hi>Cloridons</hi> friends as by <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders,</hi> that hee would not ſuffer the murder of two ſuch Knights to paſſe unpuniſhed, whom they thought had been murdred by <hi>Liſander,</hi> who (ſaid they) not content wickedly to have killed his friend <hi>Cleander</hi> by the helpe of his wives conſpiracy, is not now aſhamed to live with her in the face of all the world) writ unto his Embaſſadour that hee ſhould ſeize upon them both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which had beene done without faile, if the Embaſſadors wife, who heard an inkling thereof, had not firſt advertiſed <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who (together with <hi>Liſander</hi>) get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away as well as they could, went both together into Friſland, and ſo eſcaped this danger with no leſſe labour than the former.</p>

than by the truth of the Story. But leaving them in Friſeland, and this diſcourſe of them in the world, wee will returne unto Paris, unto which place <hi>Ambriſia</hi> came (a little after their going) upon a letter which ſhe had received from <hi>Liſander,</hi> and ſhortly after came <hi>Lidian</hi> upon a letter of <hi>Olin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s. They met all together at the ſame <hi>Olinda</hi>'s houſe with <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who received them with no leſſe contentment than they gave, by telling of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s innocency &amp; liberty; <hi>Ambriſia</hi> was as joyfull for her brother, as <hi>Lidian</hi> for his ſiſter, and for <hi>Liſander</hi> himſelfe, whom with reaſon above all men living he loved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Berontus</hi> knowing of <hi>Ambriſia</hi>'s comming, would, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his accuſtomed manner, have gone to ſee her, as one whoſe love was not altered by any former accidents: But ſhe entreated him not to think evill, if ſhee could not accept of this honour, untill there were better correſpondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and her brother; although ſhee ſo viſibly loved him, that <hi>Lidian,</hi> offended with <hi>Berontus</hi> his proſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſiſter, had challenged him into the field, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto <hi>Ambriſia</hi> and her teares, had not prevailed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe was aſſiſted by <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Argire,</hi> and by <hi>Olinda,</hi> who was alone more powerfull in this, than all of them. As for <hi>Veraſcus,</hi> the conſideration of his age kept <hi>Lidian</hi> from quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with him: But <hi>Alcidon</hi> having told unto <hi>Berontus</hi> all the treaſon of <hi>Clarinda,</hi> as you have heard, who for to hide her ſhamefull life with <hi>Leon,</hi> had accuſed her Miſtreſſe of her owne fault, and finally cauſed <hi>Cleanders</hi> death, who could not bee killed but by <hi>Leon,</hi> ſeeing it was hee who found <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanders</hi> ſword, who was at the time of <hi>Cleanders</hi> death in Flanders (as hee ſaid) hee had learnt as well from <hi>Liſander</hi> as from <hi>Calista,</hi> and that it was to be beleeved in regard of <hi>Leons</hi> flight. To be ſhort, having demonſtrated unto him, that in the taking of <hi>Leon</hi> conſiſted the cleering and proofe of the whole buſineſſe, he made both <hi>Lidian</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> ſweare to enter in queſt with himſelfe, never giving over untill either the one or the other of them had found him, and that hee who firſt ſhould finde him, ſhould lead him to Paris, and make it known unto the other. So leaving their Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7258:72"/>
at Paris, they all three one after another departed to ſeeke for <hi>Leon</hi> in all places of the world; where we will let them goe, and returne unto <hi>Liſander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have left him in Friſeland, diſputing <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s favours, whoſe beauty gave ſo full into the eyes of a young Friſon Lord called <hi>Berengarius,</hi> with ſo great lightning, that he was too weake to ſuffer it; for although her minde was poſſeſt with ſorrow, and mourning covered her face, yet could not the luſtre of her excellent perfection, wherewith ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, be defaced. <hi>Liſander,</hi> who did not lead her thither for him, ſeeing that he did openly declare himſelfe confident of the friends and meanes which he had in the Countrey, from a lover, which hee was, became jealous, and fearing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap himſelfe in new miſchiefes, yet languiſhing under the ruines of thoſe which had overwhelmed him, he knew not what order to give, when as <hi>Caliſta</hi> preventing him in this care, intreated him to lead her into ſome other place, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her reaſon, that this aire was unwholſome, &amp; hiding the feare ſhee had of the events which the raſhneſſe of this lover might produce, who being an Almain, and leſſe ſubtile than naturall, did ſo ill diſguiſe his affection, that one not ſo cleare-ſighted as <hi>Liſander</hi> might eaſily obſerve it, which was the true cauſe that moved her to make this requeſt: <hi>Liſander</hi> was glad that this motion came from her, for hee thought it was liberty enough for him to let her ſee his love, without making his jealouſie knowne, neither did he give her any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to thinke that any ſuch hammer beat in his head; but repreſenting unto her how far they were from their friends, deſtitute of all goods, which were ſeized upon and confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and had no meanes long to ſupport the expence which they were conſtrained to be at, he intreated her to be willing that he might carry her into Gaſcoigne, where hee had ſome places ſo farre from the Court, that there would bee none to diſcover them, and ſo ſtrong that they could not be ſurpriſed though they were diſcovered; whereunto <hi>Caliſta</hi> yeelded, to avoid a greater miſchiefe (which nevertheleſſe they could not ſhunne) upon condition that he ſhould firſt have her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Normandy, to endevour to recover the favour of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7258:73"/>
that having juſtified themſelves with them, they might make their innocency appeare before all the world, and ſo recovering their ancient glory and reputation which they had in France, together with the Kings grace and favour, they might with the approbation of all their friends contract to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a lawfull marriage:</p>
            <p>This being concluded and agreed upon betweene them, earely in a morning without taking leave of any body, they truſſed up their baggage, and entring into a Caroch, <hi>Liſander, Caliſta,</hi> and her two women, followed with two Gentlemen well horſed, and with ſome other ſervants, who, with his faithfull footman, ledde <hi>Liſanders</hi> good Horſe along with him; they tooke their way towards France, following the leaſt beaten wayes, that they might not be knowne. Already were they come upon the confines of Friſland, <hi>Liſander</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing both the remembrance of <hi>Berengarius</hi> and his countrey, ſtudying nothing more, than how to eſtabliſh himſelfe in his own; when they diſcovered five or ſixe horſemen comming after them, whom <hi>Berengarius</hi> (vexed at <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s departure) had aſſembled together to take her away from him upon the way. At the firſt they did not thinke that they were enemies, wherefore they haſtned not their way; but when they ſaw them come a gallop, <hi>Liſander</hi> leapt out of the Coach, &amp; was hardly on horſebacke, when hee knew <hi>Berengarius</hi> in the head of his men, who ſaluted him with a Piſtoll ſhot, and in the ſame inſtant all the others diſcharged theirs, aſwel on him as on thoſe who acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied him, who returning fire for fire diſcharged theirs; ſo that at this firſt encounter foure fell to the ground, which were <hi>Liſanders</hi> two Gentlemen, and two of <hi>Berengarius</hi> his men. But it was Gods will that <hi>Liſander</hi> ſhould eſcape, although hee were covered with flames and blood, that by his hands might be puniſhed <hi>Berengarius</hi> his rapine, who fell unto the ground mortally wounded with the ſhot of a Piſtoll, which was given him by <hi>Liſander,</hi> who like a lion flew among the reſt with his ſword, and either ſcattered or killed them all; acting in the fury wherein hee was, and in <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s ſight, ſuch valiancies, that thereby he did leſſen all thoſe which heretofore hee had done, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7258:73"/>
of the world. Having revenged the death of his men with ſo bloody an execution, and no body left with him but a little Flemmiſh boy, and his old faithfull footman, who was wounded with a Piſtoll in the ſhoulder, and hee with two ſhot, although not ſo dangerous, and with ſome blowes of ſwords which were but ſleight, he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to retire himſelfe in great diligence, and no leſſe ſorrow, untill he were gotten out of the limits of Friſland, cauſing his faithfull Footman to get upon his Horſe, hee himſelfe going into the Coach with <hi>Caliſta,</hi> untill they came unto their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where hee himſelfe dreſſed firſt his owne wounds, and then his footmans, waſhing them with wine and oyle, as he had learned of the Capuchin, who healed him of the wound which <hi>Chriſantes</hi> had given him: but becauſe the Footmans ſhoulder-bone was broken, whereby he was not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure travaile, he was conſtrained to leave him behind in the ſame lodging, to whom he gave money in large manner for the charges of healing his wounds, commanding him ſo ſoone as he ſhould be well to follow him in Gaſcoigne: he himſelfe (making the little Fle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſh boy ride upon his Horſe) went into the Coach, having no wound which could keepe him from travaile, and being but foure, drawn by ſixe good horſes, they made ſuch haſte that in ſeven or eight dayes they came into Normandy, within ſixe leagues of Bellaire (ſo was the houſe called where <hi>Caliſta</hi> had received her birth.) It was then in the beginning of April, at what time the earth begins to waxe beautifull, and the dayes long. There they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deliberation, how they ſhould proceed with <hi>Dorilas</hi>; for to go directly to <hi>Bellaire,</hi> not knowing how they ſhould be received, they were none of them of the minde: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Liſander</hi> had infinitely obliged him, as well in ſaving his owne life, as in ſaving his ſonnes twice, yet (as it is ſaid) benefits are written in the ſand, and injuries in metall: hee beleeved with great appearance, that this laſt act which hee (as it was beleeved) had committed againſt <hi>Cleander,</hi> did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deface and wipe out of the mind and memory of <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> the remembrance and merit of all his former obligations; And that if he would not ſee his owne daughter, becauſe ſhe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7258:74"/>
was accuſed for the death of her husband, he would leſſe ſee him, who had beene her inſtrument therein, and for whoſe love ſhe had cauſed him to bee killed; wherefore they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſhould write a letter full of compaſsion to her father, and another to <hi>Otranta</hi> her mother, to move them to have ſome pity of a daughter who had been ſo deare unto them, and upon their anſwer they would reſolve either to goe thither, or paſſe by. <hi>Caliſta</hi> wrote preſently, but then they were more troubled than before for an apt meſſenger: The faithfull footman was not there, &amp; the Flemming was but a block-head, and they had need of a quick ſpirited man, who might know and report backe their true diſpoſitions, and helpe abate, and put by the ſtroakes of her parents anger: So that <hi>Liſander</hi> could not finde better meanes than to diſguiſe himſelfe, and make himſelfe the Carrier of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s letters; for <hi>Dorilas</hi> had never ſeene him but one night at Fountaine Bleau, &amp; then when he had no beard: As for <hi>Otranta,</hi> he had ſo well known the affection which ſhe bare unto her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and unto him, that although ſhe ſhould know him, yet he feared no diſpleaſure from her; but contrarily they hoped ſhe would much helpe to convert <hi>Dorilas,</hi> and to wipe away the evill impreſsions which hee had conceived againſt his daughter: Wherefore the next morning he put himſelfe into a ſerving-mans habite, and having hired a horſe, taking his Flemmiſh boy with him, leaving <hi>Caliſta</hi> in the lodging he gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped ſo faſt, that he came unto Bellaire before dinner, where having made known that he came from her with letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her father and mother, &amp; being brought in unto them, he humbly preſented the letters, together with their daughters duety unto them: <hi>Dorilas</hi> made ſome difficulty to receive them, yet having opened them with a ſevere countenance, never imagining that <hi>Liſander</hi> was the meſſenger, he found it ſaid thus.</p>

                     <hi>Caliſta's</hi> Letter unto her Mother.</head>
                  <p>MAdam, when Fortune had ſo wounded mee, as to take from me, together with my husband, the contentment, the glory, and the liberty which I had in the world; one of my greateſt comforts, next unto that which I had in God, &amp; in my Conſcience, was to remember, that yet I had left a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Mother, who, according to thoſe deare affections which ſhe had ever witneſſed, would never abandon me in ſo great a deſolation, beleeving, that I had not loſt all, and that if God had taken from mee the beſt husband in the world, yet he had left me the beſt Mother under Heaven, and a Father who had ever ſhewed himſelfe kinde unto his daughter and yours. Nevertheleſſe, Madam, I have been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to fall from this comfort, to my extreme griefe, when I knew that you had not only left me, but for the top of all my misfortunes, that thoſe whom nature had given me for my Parents, were become mine enemies. Thoſe things which are moſt to bee eſteemed, are ſuch, as ought moſt to bee ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for when they are loſt; and I have not onely loſt your affection, Madam, which of all things in this world is moſt deare unto mee, but it is turned into hatred towards mee; and from being honourable and profitable, as it hath beene, it is become ſo ruinous unto me, that I ſhould have been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the miſerableſt reputation that ever poore woman was, if my honour and my life had not miraculouſly beene preſerved by him, who is falſly accuſed of <hi>Cleanders</hi> death, &amp; <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s overthrow. I have ſaid (and doe moſt humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, Madam, to pardon me) that your hatred doth mee injury many waies; for beſides that it maketh every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7258:76"/>
that I am juſtly accuſed of that which is imputed unto mee, or at the leaſt hath confirmed the beliefe which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had of my guiltineſſe (ſeeing that my Parents would not embrace my defence;) it hath conſtrained me, if I would not dye without juſtifying my ſelfe, and in the opinion of an infamous Adultereſſe and Murtherer of my Husband, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuccour &amp; refuge from him, who is yet all bloody with my husbands death, if it be true that he is guilty: which is the faireſt pretence, and the moſt lively appearance wherewith mine enemies have been able to colour the falſeneſſe of their impoſture, and whereat I cannot complaine, but onely at the hardneſſe of my Parents. Madam, I doe once againe intreat you to pardon me; my juſt and incomparable griefes cannot frame ſmall complaints: If you knew what I have ſuffered, you would abhor that ever you had brought into the world ſo miſerable a creature; if you will not take pity of my life, at the leaſt take knowledge thereof, be not more cruell than my Adverſaries, nor more criminall than my Judges: Shall it be ſaid, that a Mother refuſeth her eyes to the deportments, or her eares to the juſtification of her daughter? and if you would not that I ſhould have recourſe unto you, Madam, unto whom would you then that I ſhould have recourſe? Tell mee from whom I ſhould hope for more, or in whom I may better rely than in you, who are my Mother. And let fortune ſhoot all the arrowes of her anger upon mee (if ſhee hath any remaining which I have not felt), yet ſhee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe ſo much, but that (Madam) I will be alwayes your moſt humble and moſt obedient daughter,</p>

Alas, ſaid <hi>Otranta</hi>; he will never ſo well ſupport it as hee hath ruined it.

would you that ſhe ſhould wander up and down the world as a caſt-a-way, as you have left her? With theſe laſt words <hi>Liſander</hi> was ſo tranſported in paſſion, that forgetting the part which he plaied, he loſt both the countenance and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſervingman, and tooke upon him his owne true car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: So that <hi>Otranta</hi> marking him more curiouſly, knew him no leſſe by his geſture, than by his words, and remained almoſt tranſported with aſtoniſhment. He ſeeing himſelfe knowne, and that from thence came <hi>Otranta</hi>'s perplexity, proceeded in his diſcourſe in this manner; Madam, bee not aſtoniſhed to ſee mee thus diſguiſed, <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s vertues deſerve that all extraordinary enterpriſes ſhould bee attempted for her ſervice: But that you may know it is with that honour wherein I am tyed, I doe entreat you to take her home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and to beleeve that this requeſt is the fartheſt from my deſire (which is to bee alwayes with her) and onely to conforme my ſelfe to hers, and to let you ſee how much I preferre her contentment before that which I receive in her ſight. O <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Otranta,</hi> who can deny you ſo juſt a requeſt, and ſo fitting to <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s reputation? Alas, if it bee true (which I doubt not) that you are innocent of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and <hi>Cleanders</hi> death, what ſatisfaction can equall this your merit? Merit, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> there is none, and for my innocency, I hope God will doe me the favour to make them ſee it, who will not now beleeve it. Many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes paſſed betweene them, which would be too tedious to relate; after which, <hi>Liſander</hi> having told her where he had left <hi>Caliſta,</hi> they agreed that he ſhould returne unto her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcovering himſelfe unto <hi>Dorilas,</hi> who going two or three daies after unto the Court, would leave <hi>Otranta</hi> at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be able to ſend for her daughter.</p>
            <p>Thus was our meſſenger ſent backe, who having found his Flemming, returned a gallop the ſame night unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and gave her a faithfull account of his meſſage: <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who was wearied with leading ſo miſerable a life from one countrey to another, with ſo ſmall pleaſure and leſſe honour, ſeeing the evill opinion was conceived of her love unto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> and ſeeing how freely hee had employed himſelfe for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7258:77"/>
her in this laſt action, did no leſſe eſteeme this ſervice than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the former, becauſe in thoſe former hee had ſerved her againſt her enemies, and in this againſt himſelfe. When hee drew her out of priſon, it was to ſave her life, without which hee could not live, and to enjoy her preſence, which was his ſoveraigne good; ſo that it was to content himſelfe as well as <hi>Caliſta</hi>: But here hee laboured to loſe himſelfe with her ſight, and to condemne himſelfe unto a perpetuall torment to leave her in reſt, and he will repent himſelfe at leiſure. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe three dayes which they ſtayed in their lodging, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting <hi>Dorilas</hi> going to the Court, <hi>Caliſta</hi> never ſpake of any thing but of <hi>Liſanders</hi> goodneſſe, and how much ſhee was beholding unto him, which ſhee proteſted to engrave in her memory with an eternall character: <hi>Liſander</hi> entreated her to take pity of the griefe, which the apprehenſion of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture wrought in him, and the languiſhings which would conſume him in her abſence.</p>
            <p>Above all things Madam (ſaid he) remember the promiſe which it pleaſed you to make mee, and the honeſt affection wherewith I have endevoured to merit it. Give me not cauſe to repent the great reſpect I have born you, and the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable obedience wherewith I have moderated the violencies of my paſſion, otherwiſe you will convert my patience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fury, my diſcretion into folly, and you will reduce mee to the greateſt deſpaire that ever wretched ſoule was brought unto. Whereunto <hi>Caliſta</hi> anſwered, <hi>Liſander,</hi> either you have forgotten who I am, or elſe you thinke my judgement is not capeable of knowing what you are; yet I do not think that any of my actions or words could lead you to theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts: remember that <hi>Caliſta</hi> cannot bee accuſed of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but by ſuch as doe not know her, and although misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhould carry her to this vice againſt all the world, yet it is not poſsible ſhe ſhould be ſo to you, to whom ſhee oweth more than unto all men in the world. So did theſe lovers comfort themſelves, expecting newes from <hi>Otranta,</hi> who failed not to give them notice immediately after <hi>Dorilas</hi> his departure, which was within three dayes that <hi>Liſander</hi> had delivered <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s letters. The day of his departure being
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7258:78"/>
come, <hi>Liſander</hi> conducted <hi>Caliſta</hi> within the view of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laire (not willing to goe in with her, fearing leſt the over much ſorrow which would poſſeſſe him at his departure, might give more knowledge of his love to <hi>Otranta,</hi> than hee deſired ſhe ſhould have); and there, as they would have bid one another farewell, the faire words which were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have birth in their mouthes, dyed now there, and that which they had premeditated to ſpeake, vaniſhed; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſsing that a meane griefe ſharpneth the ſpirit, but an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive one aſtoniſheth it. In the end <hi>Liſander</hi> ſaid, this depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be leſſe cruell than it is, if it did leave mee power to bid you farewell, and my griefe would be leſſe, if it would ſuffer me to complaine: that which comforteth mee is, that I ſuffer for you, who merit more, and the cauſe of my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome allaieth the cruelty; receiving alſo ſo great glory in obeying you, that there is no kinde of torment, which my obedience and your ſervice would not make agreeable. And I conjure you my faire one, by the eternall lights of your faire eies, the onely Sun whoſe raies and eclipſes I am not able to beare (yet whoſe light I am now conſtrained to loſe) that you will forget me the leaſt you can in theſe darkneſſes, wherein I goe to inwrappe my ſelfe during your abſence. <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Caliſta,</hi> you ſee this great light which ſhineth over our heads, I doe call it to witneſſe, that it ſhall ſooner ceaſe to lighten the world, than I will ceaſe to love you: you have obliged mee too much, and when my ingratitude ſhould come to this height of forgetfulneſſe, your valour is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that it would cauſe it to be ſought for unto the worlds end. Farewell, ſince the influence of the ſtarres doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us to this ſeparation, preſerve mee alwayes in your memory, and beleeve mee, your name and repreſentation ſhall bee alwayes the deareſt jewels of my life. In ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>Caliſta</hi> lovingly kiſſed her <hi>Liſander,</hi> with more liberty than ever ſhee had done, and <hi>Liſander</hi> embraced her with feelings of joy almoſt incomprehenſible: In the end (almoſt forceably) they ſnatcht one the other out of their armes, ſeparating themſelves with ſorrow no leſſe pitifull, than the love which produced it was true. <hi>Caliſta</hi> followed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7258:78"/>
her way to Bellaire, and <hi>Liſander</hi> being on horſebacke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, with his eyes fixed upon her as ſtedfaſtly, and as immoveably, as if they had been of a Statue, untill he ſaw her Coach enter into the Caſtle: and when he had loſt his North-ſtarre, O God, what darkneſſe, what trouble, what confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on roſe in his minde! I make a conſcience to abandon him in this ſolitarineſſe, more purſued and more torne by his own affection, than <hi>Acteon</hi> by his dogges. <hi>Caliſta</hi> being come to Bellaire, was received by <hi>Otranta</hi> with great teſtimony of love, ſorrow, and pity of her misfortune: There were their teares renewed; there motherly affections ſucceeded amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and amorous gave place to motherly: cleane contrary unto poore <hi>Liſander,</hi> who onely entertained himſelfe with imaginations, and lived onely with hopes of love. Hee (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had loſt his faire Beare) tooke his way towards Paris, determining to enter by night, and ſee his friends as hee paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, or elſe to learne ſome newes, although it were with hazzard of his life: And as he paſſed S. Germyn, it being late, travailing in the freſh of the evening upon the bankes of Seine, ſoftly, as well becauſe he would ſpare his horſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not come by day light to Paris, he perceived foure Archers of the Provoſt Marſhall, who came upon a trott after him, and amongſt them hee perceived a ſouldier, a priſoner upon horſebacke, with his legges tyed under the belly. <hi>Liſander</hi> had no ſooner beheld him, but hee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred hee had ſeene his face, yet hee could not call to minde where; wherefore a little mending his pace, he entreated the Archers to tell him who hee was, and whither they carried him: Wee carry him to priſon (anſwered one of them) unto the Caſtle at Paris, where hee was ſometime Porter, and to tell you more, wee ſhould have ſomething to doe, if wee ſhould render an account of all wee take, unto all that aske us. By this anſwer, <hi>Liſander</hi> knew that it was the Porter who had delivered <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who by ill fortune was fallen into thoſe Archers hands; and being deſirous to deliver him, hee ſaid unto them: Friends, this poore man if you carry him unto Paris will be hanged, and it will but breed ſorrow unto you for having beene the cauſe of his death: but if you will
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7258:79"/>
give him unto mee, I will give you twenty crownes to goe drinke, and he ſhall be bound to pray for you all his life. We neither care for his prayers nor your crownes (anſwered an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other) and it may be, it had been better for you, you had been leſſe officious, and not ſo charitable. How (ſaid <hi>Liſander</hi>) will you alſo take me priſoner, becauſe I am charitable? Not ſo, anſwered the Archer, but if the party who cauſeth him to be taken priſoner, knew the care you have to deliver him, it may be hee would make you be further examined. Leave that care unto the party (ſaid <hi>Liſander</hi>) and deliver mee your priſoner, for I deſire much to have him. You doe but jeſt (anſwered an Archer) we will anſwer him unto the Juſtice. By your leave (replied <hi>Liſander</hi>) you ſhall not have him to priſon, before I know whether hee be willing or no to goe: and withall he ſaid unto the priſoner, ſpeake unto me friend, Is it willingly or by conſtraint that thou goeſt to priſon? By force Sir (anſwered the priſoner.) Truly then (ſaid <hi>Liſander</hi>) this is a great injuſtice in this manner to force free perſons: Well, my maſters, ſeeing you will not let him goe for mony, free him for nothing, or elſe reſolve to dye by my hand. The Archers at the firſt thought hee had beene in jeſt, or that hee had beene mad; but ſeeing him come violently upon them with his ſword in his hand, they beganne to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which ſerved them to little purpoſe; for <hi>Liſander</hi> was well horſed, and knew ſo well to take advantage by the nimbleneſſe of his Horſe, and with the goodneſſe of his ſword, that hee layed two of the ſtouteſt along upon the ground; the reſt betooke them to their heeles, leaving him the priſoner, who knowing by whom hee was freed, could not give thanks ſufficient. <hi>Liſander</hi> made his Flemmiſh boy ſpeedily unbinde him, and both of them to follow him, who in ſtead of going to Paris (as hee projected) left it upon the left hand, and taking his way towards Gaſcoigne, rode ſo hard all night, that before day he came unto Eſtampes, where having reſted himſelfe a while, he tooke Poſte with the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (who never forſooke him after that day) and his good horſe, with the Flemming, to come after by eaſie journeyes unto Tholoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:7258:79"/>In the meane time <hi>Dorilas</hi> being at Court, emplored the Kings mercy for <hi>Liſander,</hi> urging his valour, and the fidelity of this Knight, heretofore ſo remarkable for his combats and by his ſervices, hee touched (as in paſſing by) the penſion which he had refuſed from the Arch-Duke, although he had no meanes from his Majeſty, but contrary that he was in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, having loſt the honour of his favour: I do intreat you, Sir, ſaid hee, in compaſsion of this old age, and of the diſaſter wherewith I am miſerably afflicted in my laſt dayes, in the perſons of <hi>Cleander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta,</hi> to adde unto ſo many favours which you have beſtowed upon your nobility, that which I demand in <hi>Liſanders</hi> name for the death of <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes</hi>; ſlaughters which are the moſt pardonable that ever were, ſeeing that <hi>Liſander</hi> being firſt almoſt murthered by <hi>Cloridons</hi> friends, and after challenged by <hi>Chriſantes,</hi> hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone had killed them both, not only by his valour and fortune but by the juſtice of his cauſe, which had beene manifeſtly aſsiſted by the hand of God.</p>
            <p>The King poſſeſſed with the love which he had born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cloridon,</hi> and with the falſe report which ran of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, ſo much to the diſadvantage of <hi>Liſanders</hi> free and noble heart, and wondring that <hi>Dorilas</hi> with ſo much earneſtneſſe ſhould ſue for the pardon of a man who was accuſed for the murther of his ſonne in law, ſaid unto him, that he had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pardons unto his Subjects for combates nobly decided, but for Murtherers hee never gave any, marvelling further, that he would begge pardon for a man who had branded his reputation with ſo foule a fault, and who had ſo mortally offended him in the perſon of one moſt neare unto him, wherby he had deſerved to have his condemnation purſued. It is for this cauſe, Sir, anſwered <hi>Dorilas,</hi> that I demand <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanders</hi> pardon, touching <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes</hi> deaths, whereof I accompt him innocent, that hee may be puniſhed for the murther of <hi>Cleander</hi> (if it be true that hee be guilty.) Cleane otherwiſe (replied the King) <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes</hi> friends thinke him guilty of their deaths, and innocent of the other, ſo either of you is tranſported with his particular paſsion: But I, who am or ought to be guided with reaſon
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7258:80"/>
onely, will give unto every one that juſtice which is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Sir, anſwered <hi>Dorilas,</hi> to the doing of juſtice, firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the knowing of the cauſe, and to the knowing of the cauſe, belongs the hearing of the parties: Your Majeſty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly condemne <hi>Liſander</hi> without firſt hearing his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but agreeing that hee killed <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes,</hi> it followes that hee did well or ill kill them; if well, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that your Majeſty may pardon him; and if ill, you may puniſh him after you have given him pardon: for juſtice doth not allow of pardons gotten upon a falſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; ſo your Majeſty may in time bee cleare of <hi>Liſanders</hi> innocency in reſpect of the combat. For I am ſure he will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfe, not onely to prove that he killed them like an honeſt man, but alſo to purge himſelfe from <hi>Cleanders</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which I the rather deſire, Sir, becauſe upon his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dependeth <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s.

               </gap>els when it was committed, and that he left his ſword (by which circumſtance they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of the murther) in the field where he killed <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantes,</hi> having broken it in the hilts with the reverſe blow wherewith he cut off <hi>Chriſantes</hi> his arme, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe both with <hi>Cloridons</hi> horſe and ſword, which he yet hath. But, Sir, though this did not nor could appeare, what better courſe can your Majeſty hold, than that which your progenitors have held? alwayes when ſuch caſes have hapned, ſo doubtfull that the truth could not bee knowne, they have granted the combate to the accuſers or the accuſed, who did demand it. There was ſtanding by at the Kings din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where <hi>Dorilas</hi> pleaded <hi>Liſanders</hi> cauſe, a young Knight called <hi>Lucidon,</hi> who was <hi>Chriſantes</hi> his Nephew, and one of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7258:80"/>
the activeſt Gentlemen of France, who hearing pardon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for his Uncles death, and fearing leſt <hi>Dorilas</hi> his reaſons might bee of force with the King, proſtrated himſelfe at his Majeſties feet, moſt humbly beſeeching him, that the death of two ſuch Knights as <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes</hi> might not go unpuniſhed for want of proofe, ſeeing it was well knowne ſuch actions were alwaies performed with the feweſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that could bee brought, and that <hi>Liſander</hi> had killed all that could witneſſe; yea even unto the foot-boyes, thereby, as it was moſt likely, to hide the foule play of the combate. That in caſe it could not be verified according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forme of juſtice, hee did require that according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alledged by <hi>Dorilas,</hi> hee might be ſuffered to challenge <hi>Liſander,</hi> and decide this combate by a ſecond combate. Whereunto <hi>Dorilas</hi> anſwered, The Kings preſence (<hi>Lucidon</hi>) makes you ſpeake, and me hold my peace, but if the inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect which we owe unto his Ma. were not, this white beard (ſuch as you ſee it) would enforce it ſelfe to ſhew you that there was no foule play in that action, and if the King pleaſe, without entring into further proofe, I doe offer to maintaine it in the field, my perſon againſt yours.

And having granted <hi>Liſanders</hi> pardon, upon condition that hee did come and procure it to bee allowed within one moneth; and that he might ſafely come and juſtifie himſelfe of <hi>Cleander<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Lady was called <hi>Hippolita,</hi> whoſe parents had left her an Orphant under the tuition of a Kinſman of hers, who in her firſt youth was carefull to ſecond her good nature with exquiſite education; as the creſcent of her beauty was perfected with ripe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> neereneſſe of blood, he could not forbeare witneſsing more love than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of parentage: which ſo much offended the young heart of this maid, that the firſt time he went out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (which was exceeding ſtrong) where ſhe was brought up, ſhe ſhut the gates upon him, keeping him out; there with a maid ſhee had called <hi>Eriſila,</hi> of like age and diſpoſition, ſhe gave her ſelfe not onely to ſuch exerciſes which thoſe of her ſexe do ordinarily uſe, but alſo to ſuch as are fitting unto men, every day riding of horſes, and exerciſe of Armes, which ſhe did with an unſpeakeable dexterity: and this was privately within the incloſure of the Caſtle wals: but ſhortly after, her Tutor endevouring to ſurpriſe her by force, was ſhamefully beaten by his Pupill, and by her valour repulſed, whereat he tooke ſuch griefe, that he died, leaving <hi>Hippolita</hi> free from his love and government. She had alſo joyned unto theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſo perfect a knowledge in learning, that thoſe who were not taken with the unevitable ſtrokes of her face, were conſtrained to yeeld themſelves to the charmes of her ſpeech, and the ſweetneſſe of her converſation.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7258:83"/>
Hee alſo knew that <hi>Liſander</hi> was loſt in <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that upon the ſudden to endevour to quench thoſe fires, which were ſo lively in him, to kindle new unto a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whom hee had not ſeene, hee thought it would be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe altogether in vaine; wherefore the ſubtile old man deſired that hee might ſee her before hee made any demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his intent, hoping that of himſelfe he would come into the net, and the rather, if he were not advertiſed before hand. To attaine hereunto, hee made a match of hunting, unto which <hi>Hippolita</hi> was intreated, who failed not to come: but hearing that this brave <hi>Liſander</hi> (whoſe vertue had ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo loud in her eares) would be there, ſhee ſtudyed with great Art to tye all thoſe graces together, wherewith ſhee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to have her admirable beauty accompanied. For although ſhe had no particular deſigne upon his perſon, yet the glory which ſhee did apprehend in captivating ſuch a courage, made her deſire to ſeeme faire. She therefore appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled her ſelfe in a hunting garment after the Saramatick fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, of crimſon Velvet, embroydered with ſilver, over which hung in a rich ſcarfe, a faire ſword with an excellent grace, her haire was gathered up under a little cap almoſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with feathers, and ſet thicke with ſtones, which gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about her head, dazzled their ſight who beheld her; but it was little in reſpect of the lightning which came from her face. Her horſe was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ennet of Spain, white as Snow, which ſhee rode upon rather for bravery than to hunt with. In this manner accompanied with <hi>Eriſila</hi> her maid (whoſe habite was of the ſame faſhion, but not of the ſame ſtuffe) ſhee met the Aſſembly. On the other ſide <hi>Liſander,</hi> unto whom had beene already figured the cleereneſſe of this bright ſtarre, as of a riſing Sunne, called for <hi>Cloridons</hi> horſe, and girding his good ſword upon a skarlet ſuit, laced thicke with gold lace, ſettled himſelf in a ſaddle of the ſame, and followed <hi>Adraſtus</hi> with thoſe who were of the match.</p>
            <p>When they came to the place where they intended to caſt off their dogges, they found in the ſame eſtate I did repreſent, <hi>Hippolita,</hi> who both rejoiced and aſtoniſhed all the troupe with her preſence. Never did <hi>Atlas</hi> appeare ſo faire to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:7258:84"/>
when ſhe hunted the Theſſalian Bore, as ſhe then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> whom ſhe beheld with an eye full of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; ſhee thinking that hee was the faireſt object to be ſeene amongſt men. And indeede there was none in the company that did not thinke ſo, nor any minde ſo envious which did not confeſſe that they were the faireſt couple in the world: but that which raiſed greateſt admiration, was the ſweetnes and gentlenes of their countenance, with fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their courages; for they ſeemed to be two contraries in one ſubject, and (which was rarely found but in them) equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fierce and gentle, whoſe hearts were uncapable of feare in any danger, and tractable and eaſie in converſation. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Liſander</hi> were in war ſterne and haughty, yet in peace there was nothing more humble: and although <hi>Hippolita</hi> was (amongſt Ladies) both perfectly faire and humble, yet ſhee was no leſſe warlike and ſtout in armes. And I doe not know which was moſt rare to finde, either ſo much beauty in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanders</hi> valour, or ſo much valour in <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s beauty. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fell to the ſport of hunting, <hi>Liſander</hi> alighted from his horſe, having firſt made him curvet and bound an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times before <hi>Hippolita,</hi> with ſuch juſtneſſe and grace, that thoſe who had taken pleaſure in beholding him before, confeſſed it was nothing in reſpect of what they received in this action: <hi>Hippolita</hi> her ſelfe more than all was raviſhed by him, whom without doubt ſhe had raviſhed, if hee had not been formerly gained by another; but his ſoule was ſo filled with the moſt excellent perfections of <hi>Caliſta,</hi> that there was no place left for <hi>Hippolita</hi> to make any impreſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Liſander</hi> finding <hi>Hippolita</hi> with a minde free and unpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed like a ſmooth white paper, writ in fiery letters the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting progreſſe of his love. All the hunting they gallopped cloſe one by the other, to <hi>Adraſtus</hi> his great contentment, who did beleeve that <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s converſation would work the ordinary effect in <hi>Liſander,</hi> as in all others, which was, to force him to ſubjection, which all the company beleeved as well as <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Liſander,</hi> obliged with ſo much beauty, and with his own nobleneſſe, ſpake unto her of love, unto which ſhe anſwered, mocking and feigning not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7258:84"/>
that which indeed ſhee ought not to have beleeved. In the end, their hunting finiſhing with the killing of a great Stagge, as they were upon their returne, they found in a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice a huge overgrowne Boare, ſo furious and terrible, that neither the Huntſmen with their darts, neither the dogges with their Collars ſtucke with iron points, durſt behold his wilde countenance. <hi>Liſander</hi> ſeeing this, leaps from his horſe, and ſets upon him with his ſword, and with much adoe and ſome danger hee thruſt it in betweene the Boares ſhoulders up to the hilts: But the blow, although it were mortall, could not ſtay the violence of this fearefull beaſts motion, nor <hi>Liſander</hi> ſo nimbly ſhift himſelfe, that hee did not ruſh upon him, and overwhelme him to the ground, carrying away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his tuskes a great peece of his Caſſaque, ſo that every one thought him dead: When <hi>Adraſtus</hi> ſaw his ſonne fall, it is not to be demanded whether hee were troubled, and faire <hi>Hippolita</hi> was no leſſe, who nimbly leaping from her horſe, inſtantly ranne before all the reſt to helpe him up. But there was no ſuch need, he riſing without helpe or hurt, but onely the ſhame he had for his fall; and the Boare falling upon the other ſide dead, revived their hearts which were troubled, and raiſed great joy to ſucceede this feare, and a great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſoule of <hi>Hippolita,</hi> unto whom the glory of ſo hardy an action, was as a bellowes to kindle her new fire. <hi>Liſander,</hi> having preſented unto her what they had killed, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the reſt of the company went with her untill they came within view of her houſe, and there obtaining leave to viſite her, hee returned unto Miramont after <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> more ſatisfied than amorous of her beauty. While theſe things thus paſſed, the time (within which <hi>Dorilas</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to preſent <hi>Liſander</hi>) approached, and there was no newes of him, nor yet of the meſſenger whom he had ſent: which brought care unto <hi>Dorilas,</hi> griefe unto <hi>Otranta,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſpaire unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who knew not what to ſay, nor what to think of <hi>Liſander.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Lidian</hi> having travelled all the Kingdome over to finde <hi>Leon,</hi> without lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any newes of him, moved with an earneſt deſire of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lady, at the time which was agreed by <hi>Alcidon, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:7258:85"/>
and himſelfe, came backe unto Paris, where having heard of the words that paſſed from <hi>Lucidon</hi> unto his father, he preſently challenged him. <hi>Lucidon</hi> bravely accepted it, and both of them demeaned themſelves ſo valiantly, that they were carried both grievouſly wounded out of the field, with more appearance of death than hope of life. <hi>Lucidon</hi> got great reputation in bearing himſelfe ſo valiantly againſt <hi>Lidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> whoſe valour was often approved, and had challenged him, although hee had but lately entred his pardon for the like former fact: wherefore his friends fearing leſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of juſtice would ſearch for him, all wounded as he was, carried him in a Litter by night from <hi>Olinda</hi>'s houſe where he firſt was brought, unto a houſe of <hi>Argires</hi> in the countrey, foure miles from Paris, named Clarevall, whither came <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gire, Olinda</hi> and <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> who, expecting to heare ſome newes of her brother, had alwaies remained with them, and borne them faithfull company.</p>
            <p>In the meanetime <hi>Dorilas,</hi> ſeeing the month expired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which time he had promiſed unto the King to bring in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> returned to Paris, with an intent to combate <hi>Lucidon</hi> himſelf, according to the offer which had been made and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. But when he came there, finding that his ſonne had prevented him, and was yet in his bedde wounded, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that it would be thought to be done by his advice, to excuſe him from that wherein he had formerly ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he was no leſſe angry with him for fighting, than ſorry for his wounds; yet underſtanding that hee was carried to Clarvall, hee went to ſee him, and from thence writ unto <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranta</hi> newes of this accident. Shee hearing that her ſonne was wounded, and lay at <hi>Argires</hi> houſe neere Paris, came thither with <hi>Caliſta</hi> as ſpeedily as ſhee could, and as ſecretly as was poſſible. I neede not relate the complements, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments and words which paſſed amongſt the Ladies, eſpecially with <hi>Caliſta,</hi> neither could I expreſſe them: Only I will ſay, that having found <hi>Lidian</hi> a little better than they thought, their ſorrow was turned into joy, ſeeing themſelves together, although it was not perfect. For beſides <hi>Lidians</hi> wounds, the abſence of <hi>Alcidon, Liſander</hi> his quarrels, and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi>'s
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7258:85"/>
proceſſe, were ſharpe thornes amongſt theſe roſes.</p>
            <p>In the meane time ſuch as were equally friends unto <hi>Lidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Lucidon,</hi> ſeeing they were recovered of their wounds, and ſeeing the ſmall cauſe for them to remaine enemies, there having no words of injury paſſed betweene them, and their wounds being equal, they determined to make them friends, knowing that with the ſervice which they ſhould doe unto the two Knights in agreeing them, they ſhould alſo pleaſe the King which did deſire it. The honour, the friends, and the nobleneſſe of their proceeding had imprinted more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than the blood which they had drawn one from the other had left hatred, wherefore they were eaſily diſpoſed to agreement, provided, that in their agreement there might be no ſpeech held of <hi>Liſander,</hi> who was the firſt cauſe of their diſpute: but when they ſhould ſee one the other (which muſt bee of neceſſity) becauſe <hi>Lidian</hi> durſt not come unto Paris, <hi>Lucidon</hi> was brought unto Clarvall, where firſt embracing <hi>Dorilas,</hi> and after <hi>Lidian,</hi> he was raviſhed with the beauty of the company, eſpecially when his eyes beheld <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who blinded him with ſo violent a paſsion of love, that from a mortall enemy, which (not long ſince) he was of her whole houſe, he was now become a moſt affectionate ſervant. He was young, rich, well favoured, comely of perſonage, of an excellent ſpirit, and a great courage; charmes which might prevaile much with women, which nevertheleſſe were not of force with <hi>Calista,</hi> whoſe heart was ever turned towards <hi>Liſander</hi> as the Needle is towards the North, although at this time his abſence, and the little newes of him, had much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her. <hi>Lucidon</hi> finding in <hi>Caliſta</hi> a minde drowned in ſorrow for the death of <hi>Cleander,</hi> and onely (as he conceived) capable of griefe, as well for his death as that ſhe was thereof accuſed, and not yet juſtified, contented himſelfe onely to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her all his ſervice, as well in this as in any other, neither pretending nor hoping for more recompence, than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to call himſelfe her Knight. And ſo he tooke his leave, with his friends returning to Paris, more wounded with the arrowes of her eyes, than he had beene before by <hi>Lidian</hi> her brother, and no leſſe ſtudying which way to gaine her, than
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7258:86"/>
to deſtroy <hi>Liſander,</hi> whom all the world knew both to love her, and to be beloved by her, thinking therby to ſatisfie both his love and hatred together: wherefore the moneth which the King had given for him to come and enter his pardon was no ſooner paſt, but <hi>Lucidon</hi> remonſtrated unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that his crime heretofore cleere enough was now more than notorious, that otherwiſe hee would never have failed to appeare within the time which was limited for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying his pardon, which was procured with ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but that <hi>Liſander,</hi> convinced by his conſcience, fledde the light of the Sunne which diſcovered him, confeſſing by his flight, that hee could neither deny it in juſtice, nor defend it with armes. He therefore entreated his Majeſty to revoke the pardon given him, &amp; yeeld unto the ſhadowes of <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes</hi> the contentment of ſeeing juſtice done upon their murtherer; and if any were found who in his abſence would defend him in ſo evill a cauſe, that hee might be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fight with him, and ſubmit his right unto the triall of armes. The King taking <hi>Liſanders</hi> abſence as an ill ſigne, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that if within three weekes hee came not, nor ſome other for him to fight with <hi>Lucidon,</hi> the pardon which was offered unto him ſhould be void, and hee himſelfe ſhould be put into the hands of juſtice. Further, his Majeſty ordained, that the combate ſhould bee on horſebacke, the combatants armed at all points, and in the preſence of his Majeſty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient cuſtome of this Kingdome: This order comming unto <hi>Dorilas</hi> his eare, he diſpatched <hi>Lidian</hi> away in Poſte unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> remaining himſelfe at Clarevall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting newes.</p>
            <p>But being one day at Paris (whither hee ordinarily went) a little after <hi>Lidians</hi> departure, hee met with two Gaſcoigne Gentlemen of his acquaintance, who came lately out of the country, by whom informing himſelfe of <hi>Liſander,</hi> no way diſguiſing the trouble of minde that hee had by his abſence, conſidering what buſineſſe called him thither; they told him, that they had left him about a buſineſſe which did well deſerve his ſtay. And what buſineſſe (ſaid <hi>Dorilas</hi>) can be of ſuch importance unto him, that it can make him forget the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7258:86"/>
care which he ought to have of his honour and his life? Wee know not (ſaid they) neither doth he beleeve that his honour doth oblige him to come hither; but the cauſe which detains him there, is (I think) partly becauſe he cannot be here in that ſafety which he deſires, and partly for the ſatisfaction which hee deſires to give unto his parents after ſo long an abſence, but the true and ſtrongeſt chaine, which tyeth him, is the love which hee beares unto a faire Amazon, who will not give him ſo much liberty to runne up and downe in the world as hee hath done. Then did they ſo lively deſcribe <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s vertues and beauties, adding the greatneſſe of her eſtate unto her other perfections, that <hi>Dorilas</hi> certainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved it was the onely reaſon why <hi>Liſander</hi> was deafe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his letters, and infinitely bewailing that he had ſent <hi>Lidian</hi> unto him, hee returned to carry this newes to <hi>Caliſta</hi> at Clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall. To tell you the ravage which this newes made in her minde, the rage and the fury of her jealouſie, the deſpite and the ſhame ſhe had, to ſee her ſelfe ſo deſpiſed and deceived by a man, who had adored her with ſubmiſſions and humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as if it had beene to a Deity, it is not poſsible, it muſt bee conceived by thought, or bee repreſented by ſome other woman injured by the feeling of the like affront: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Caliſta,</hi> being wiſe and adviſed as well as faire, wiſely diſſembled, in the company, what ſhee felt, and ſhewed her ſelfe ſo diſcreete and conſtant in this firſt motion, that one would have judged this act of <hi>Liſander</hi> to have beene indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; but after ſhee was retired into her chamber, and her doore ſhut upon her, that ſhe ſaw ſhe was at liberty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, then her griefe, too too ſtrong for her reaſon, enforced her to words and actions which cannot be related; for with the complaints ſhe made, and the teares ſhe ſhed, little wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſhe did not yeeld up her life: Ah Traytor (ſaid ſhe) and the moſt ſpotted with infidelity that the ſunne ever ſaw, is it thus, that thou at need leaveſt the too eaſie and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Caliſta</hi>! at the leaſt ungratefull; thou ſhouldſt have ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed untill ſhee had recovered the honour which by thy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhee hath loſt, and thou ſhouldeſt have aſſured the life which the too much affection ſhee hath borne thee, hath
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7258:87"/>
brought into deſpaire: but cruell as thou art, thou haſt left me in the hands of juſtice, from whence thou haſt drawne me, onely to prolong my torment with my life. Ah diſloyall, it is not now that thou diddeſt deceive mee: This <hi>Hippolita,</hi> whoſe praiſes in my hearing thou didſt ſing, perſwading me that it was a counterfeit name under which thou hiddeſt mine, was the true ſubject of thy paſſion; and Sot that I am, I tooke it to mine advantage, and fedde my ſelfe with praiſes and affections which thou breathedſt for another. What ſhould I make account of any mans fidelitie? Let Heaven and Hell torment mee for ever with ſome new puniſhment (if they have any wherewith they have not afflicted mee) if ever I ſuffer my ſelfe to be overtaken again by any man. Thus without eyther comfort or counſaile the faire <hi>Caliſta</hi> lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambriſia</hi> who was preſent at theſe newes, was little leſſe afflicted than ſhee, and knew not what reaſons to uſe in her brothers excuſe. <hi>Olinda, Otranta</hi> and <hi>Argire</hi> were all in the ſame aſtoniſhment, &amp; as one hardly beleeveth that which is not ſeene, they could not imagine that <hi>Liſander</hi> in ſo ſmall a time could be ſo much changed, or have fallen into ſo great a forgetfulneſſe of himſelfe, they all ſuppoſing that although he had loſt the memory of his love, yet hee would alway pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that of his honour, which did oblige him to juſtifie <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi> in verifying his owne innocency, and that neceſſarily ſome other great accident beſides love had ſtayed him. <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> himſelfe was of that opinion, although thoſe who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this evill newes (not dreaming of the griefe which they brought with them) had told him for a certaintie of their knowledge, as being at the hunting where <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Hippolita</hi> firſt ſaw themſelves together. But <hi>Caliſta</hi> taking it at the worſt, and thinking her ſelfe the moſt wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ever was, being aſhamed ever to appeare in the world, or in the preſence of her owne parents, or almoſt to ſee her ſelfe after ſuch unſupportable miſeries as ſhee had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, reſolved upon the ſtrongeſt deſigne that could fall into a womans thought: firſt ſhe would neither ſee nor be ſeene of any perſon; and having commanded that they ſhould
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7258:87"/>
leave her, that ſhe might take her reſt, ſhe ſpent the day in ſad and bitter ſolitarineſſe, eating her heart in ſilence, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating deepely in thoſe furies wherewith ſhee was troubled, and when night deſcending with ſleep had wrapped all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures elſe in their reſt, ſhe ſoftly roſe from her bed, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out awaking any ſervant) ſhee went from her owne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, unto that wherein <hi>Lidian</hi> lay before his departure. There finding, amongſt many other neceſſary implements which hee had left behinde him, a ſuite of greene Sattin laid thicke with ſilver, which he had but newly made, with a ſilke Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graine cloke of the ſame colour, and laced, in briefe, all things ſuteable, ſhee accommodateth her ſelfe therewith as well as ſhe could; her legges ſhee hides with his Bootes, by her ſide ſhe hangs his ſword, and her long haire ſhee covered with a gray Bever, ſhadowed with a greene Feather; afterwards going unto the Stable (having firſt tooke all her money with her) ſhe her ſelfe choſe and made ready the beſt horſe <hi>Dorilas</hi> had in the Stable, and getting upon him, went to the next way ſhe met, in the horrour of a dark night, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what way ſhee ſhould keepe, or what reſolution ſhee ſhould take.</p>
            <p>Who will not now confeſſe unto mee, that love is a rage which troubleth the moſt ſettled braines, ſince that <hi>Caliſta</hi> (who lived in the opinion of a Lady ſo wiſe, that the death of her husband, the infamy of a priſon, the loſſe of her wealth and reputation, the beleefe of her parents, or the extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a ſhamefull death could not move) was ſhaken and carried from all her conſtancy by the firſt ſtrokes of a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? and more light, and more a woman than ever ſhe had witneſſed her ſelfe, ſhe forgot the griefe which ſhe had raiſed unto her parents, the ſcandall which ſhee had brought unto her houſe, her owne honour, which had beene (untill that time) ſo deare unto her, to expoſe her ſelfe unto the wide world for the uncertaine newes of a contrived untruth, and runne (as it is ſaid) blindfoldly rather after her owne deſpaire than upon any well placed reſolution.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Otranta</hi> and <hi>Dorilas</hi> would go ſee their daughter, and finding her gowne which ſhee had left in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7258:88"/>
place of <hi>Lidians</hi> habit; one tore her haire, the other his beard, both of them called themſelves miſerable, having children at ſuch rate, thinking none happy but thoſe who had none. Sorrow redoubleth in this houſe, and that which over night was but an ordinary evill, in the morning became extreme. In vaine is ſhe ſought after; for thoſe who came backe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding her, confirmed her loſſe unto her parents, and made their griefe almoſt paſt remedy.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Adrastus</hi> ſeeing <hi>Liſanders</hi> love with <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita</hi> did not kindle and burne (as hee hoped) at firſt, after many other ſubtilties, ſaid unto his ſonne, that now being old, the greateſt contentment that <hi>Hypermeſtra</hi> and he could at theſe yeeres have, was to ſee him retire himſelfe home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; That hee had runne enough up and downe in the world, it was fit now to reſt, and that it was high time for him to take the houſe to his care, and ſuffer his father and mother to divide the remainder of their yeeres in reſt: not that he would abridge him of going to the Court, where hee knew well his honour did oblige him, to purge himſelfe as well from <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes</hi> deaths, whom he had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as alſo from <hi>Cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ders,</hi> which (as he ſaid) he not ſo much as thought; but that this might be done with time, and in the mean while he would be glad to have him make choice of ſuch a party who might tye him to ſtay in the countrey, offering to aſſiſt him as a father, and as he had alwayes done in all places untill this very time; That it was told him he had ſome deſigne upon <hi>Hippolita,</hi> but for ſome conſiderations which were unknowne he had not yet witneſſed it; That if it were out of any doubt that hee would not be willing, hee would cleare that doubt by telling then that he knew <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita</hi> to be of an illuſtrious family, of a vertuous condition, of a rare beauty, and that hee did not know any in the world whom hee would rather deſire to be his daughter in law; That if peradventure hee feared hee ſhould not be able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the end of his ſuit, and that this did keepe him from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his ſuit, hee did ingage himſelfe to draw aſſurance from her, that hee ſhould not loſe his labour nor travaile in vaine in her ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:7258:88"/>
               <hi>Liſander</hi> wondring at this ſpeech, knew well that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ingage him to marry with <hi>Hippolita,</hi> whom hee would have purchaſed at any price (excepting <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e) but there was no duety of a ſonne, nor reverence of a father could draw him from ſo happy a captivity as hers, to ſerve in any other place: yet not willing to loſe the reſpect which he ought him, with obedience he anſwered, That the ſmall ſtay he had made in the countrey, and the diſorder of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, had kept him from thinking of marriage, not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it fit to be ſuitor for a wife while hee had ſuch criminall proceſſes upon his hands, and ſuch deadly quarrels: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſeeing he did witneſſe it to be his pleaſure, he would alwaies conforme himſelfe, eſpecially for ſo faire a ſubject as <hi>Hippolita</hi> was, whom hee knew more worthy to be ſerved, than he thought himſelfe capable of ſerving her. But before hee did embarke himſelfe, hee did entreat to ſuffer him to make one voyage unto the Court, to give ſilence unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſlanders which unworthily did injure his reputation; that being returned, he would unfallibly ſerve <hi>Hippolita,</hi> and would ſpend the reſt of his dayes under the ſhadow of his houſe, if he pleaſed. <hi>Liſander</hi> (ſaid <hi>Adraſtus</hi>) you aske leave of mee to goe unto the Court, where you dare not appeare without evident danger of loſing your ſelfe: you promiſe me to ſerve <hi>Hippolita</hi> at your returne, even as hee who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the <hi>grand Signeur</hi> to teach an Elephant to ſpeake, and tooke ſo long a time, that it was not poſſible but either the <hi>grand Signeur,</hi> or the Elephant, or himſelfe muſt be dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he were tyed to the accompliſhment. I ſee how it is, you are bewitched in the love of <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who hath reduced you to the brink of your ruine, and whom you have in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner drawne into like danger. You may doe what you pleaſe, but remember it ſhall never bee with my liking. By theſe words <hi>Liſander</hi> knew that his father underſtood little leſſe of his buſineſſe than himſelfe. This ſaid, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe away, and not expecting any reply, left <hi>Liſander</hi> in great perplexity. And although hee reſolved rather to ſuffer any thing, than the loſſe of his Love, yet hee intended to ſearch
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7258:89"/>
ſome meanes, whereby in keeping her, he might not loſe his parents favour. At night, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> being gone into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to take a turne, rather to digeſt his thoughts than his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Liſander</hi> tooke occaſion to ſpeake unto his mother <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permeſtra,</hi> unto whom hee told the words which his Father had ſaid unto him, and his anſwer (which ſhe already knew from <hi>Adraſtus</hi>) with the diſcontentment which thereby hee received, whereat hee was ſo grieved, that although hee did paſsionately deſire to returne unto the Court, for the reaſons which he had alledged unto his Father, yet he had rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them and all extremities, than diſpleaſe him; For this cauſe having more ripely conſidered of it, he reſolved to obey him in whatſoever he ſhould pleaſe to command: And becauſe he had declared that his pleaſure was he ſhould ſerve <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita,</hi> he was determined (by his good will) the next morning to goe ſee her, which he humbly entreated <hi>Hypermeſtra</hi> to let him underſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hypermestra,</hi> glad that her ſonne had better bethought himſelfe, ſaid, that ſhe never hoped leſſe from his education and good nature, and confirming him in this reſolution, ſhe that night advertiſed <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> who was much rejoiced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The next morning <hi>Liſander</hi> pompouſly cloathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as one who went to ſee his Miſtreſſe, and taking with him onely his faithfull footman, his Flemming, and the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Caſtle at Paris, who was now become Groome of his chamber; he gallopped unto <hi>Hippolita,</hi> loaded with bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of his Parents, who accompanied his journey with vowes, and thanked God that hee was ſo diſpoſed to obey them: but the old folkes were much deceived, as wee ſhall ſhortly ſee, and thereby a ſtrange effect of the power of love, which of the moſt loyall and the moſt abſolute man (one of them in the world as <hi>Liſander</hi> was) made him a deceiver of his parents, betraying the hopes which hee had given them, and afflicted their age with as much griefe as was poſsible. Hee went therefore unto <hi>Hippolita,</hi> with whom hee pratled ſome ſmall time of love, like a man who had more upon his lippes than in his heart, and charmed her ſo well, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting

unto her the neceſſity of his affaires which did oblige him to returne unto the Court, he procured her to write this letter to his Father <hi>Adraſtus.</hi>

            <p>This letter was no ſooner diſpatched, but <hi>Liſander</hi> tooke his leave of <hi>Hippolita,</hi> fearing leſt his Father might come and ſtay him there: and determining to goe into Normandy to ſee <hi>Caliſta,</hi> he made haſte, and ridde great journies; yet when he was at Bourdeaux hee heard of a magnifick tilting which was in England, where deſiring to be, he changed his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and ſending the groome of his chamber with a letter unto <hi>Caliſta</hi>; hee embarked himſelfe upon Garrowne, with his footman, directing his courſe for the river Thames. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus</hi> having received <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s letter, knew well that his ſonne had gone beyond him, whereat he was much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. In the midſt of which diſcontent, <hi>Lidian</hi> arrived at Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramont, and not finding <hi>Liſander</hi> there, he addreſſed himſelfe unto his Father, unto whom he told how <hi>Dorilas</hi> had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his pardon, upon condition that hee preſented himſelfe within a moneth; That hee had expreſly ſent a Gentleman to advertiſe him ſo much, of whom, as alſo of <hi>Liſander,</hi> there was no newes. So that the moneth being paſt, the King had given his laſt order, by which, not preſenting himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three weekes, hee was to be declared guilty of the crimes whereof he was accuſed; That all France wondred at his not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7258:90"/>
appearance in this needfull occaſion, and did thinke him convicted; That his friends could not tell what to thinke, nor what to doe, but onely to preſent themſelves at the laſt day, to fight with his accuſers in his abſence. But what a ſhame would that be (ſaid he) in the ſight of ſo great a King, that <hi>Liſanders</hi> friends ſhould enter combate for his cauſe, he in the meane time being idle in the countrey? <hi>Adraſtus</hi> more vexed at this laſt newes than at the former, knew not what anſwer to make unto <hi>Lidians</hi> ſpeeches, but, that they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard of Gentleman, nor any man elſe that brought let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Dorilas</hi>; that this was the firſt word hee had heard of his pardon: And as for <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſee what is written unto me, which I received but now; and ſaying this, hee ſhewed him <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s letter. <hi>Lidian</hi> marvelling that there was no newes of the Gentleman, and ſorry that he had miſſed of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> comforted himſelfe with hearing that hee was gone unto the Court: and giving unto <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and <hi>Hypermeſtra Ambriſia</hi>'s letter (wherewith they were much rejoiced) hee ſtayed only one night at Miramont, departing the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning early, and determining to ſee <hi>Hippolita</hi> as he paſſed by, as well for the eſtimation was made of her, as to make a true diſcovery of <hi>Liſanders</hi> waies; hee found her, ſuch as ſhe was deſcribed unto him, exceeding faire: and having underſtood by her, that <hi>Liſander</hi> was gone towards Bourdeaux, and by eaſie journies, he thought if he did goe Poſte, he might come thither as ſoone as <hi>Liſander</hi>: for which cauſe hee tooke his leave, being much ſatisfied with her faſhion and behaviour, and preſently tooke his way after his friend: Nevertheleſſe <hi>Liſander</hi> had made ſuch haſte, thinking his father was ſtill at his heeles, that he was departed from Bourdeaux the very day that <hi>Lidian</hi> came thither; wherefore beleeving that it was not Gods will, out of ſome ſecret judgement which hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not, that he ſhould meet him, he reſolved to ride no more after him, eſteeming it unprofitable, ſeeing he travelled to bring him unto a place, whither (it was ſaid) he was gone before. And hearing of the great tilting which was to bee in England, hee reſolved to breake a Launce there: a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthy of a raſh man, rather than of <hi>Lidian,</hi> who knew
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7258:90"/>
well the great griefe wherein he had left his parents, neither would he ever have undertaken this journy, but through the aſſurance which was given him in ſo many ſeverall places, that <hi>Liſander</hi> was gone unto the Court.</p>
            <p>Let us now returne unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> whom we have left wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring alone ſo long, and ſee what became of her. After that ſhee was gone from Clarevall, her horſe which was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to Paris way, brought her about breake of the day unto the gates of that great City; and then remembring the times which ſhe formerly ſpent there, in the glory of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and comparing it unto her preſent miſery, her heart was likely to melt in her breaſt, and come forth at her eyes: Ah <hi>Caliſta</hi> (ſaid ſhee) what meaneſt thou to doe? what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne haſt thou taken? unto what extremity hath thy misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune reduced thee? dareſt thou ever returne before the face of thy parents, having thus injured them? But coward as thou art, why ſpeakeſt thou either of comming in thy parents ſight, or of living in the world after this affront? No, no, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta,</hi> thou muſt dye once for all, and in dying, tye about the necke of thy ungratefull Lover the revenging furies of this death. In ſaying this, ſhe entred into the city, covering with her cloake her face, which was all wet with teares, and went to ſeeke for a lodging toward the Temple, the moſt retired part of all Paris, leſt ſhe ſhould be knowne. Having reſted a little (if the griefe, which did continually racke her, may be called reſt) ſhe called her Hoſte, and intreated him to get her a ſervant, who was an honeſt fellow, &amp; could dreſſe a horſe, and to cauſe an Armorer to come unto her. An Armorer, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my Hoſte, you ſhall preſently have, but an honeſt ſervant is not found in a ſmall time: yet I will get you ſuch a one, for whom aſſurance ſhall be given: Saying this, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Armorer to be ſent for, of whom ſhee beſpake an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour complete, all blacke, with a deviſe of a wheele, like unto one of thoſe uſed in watring of gardens, incompaſſed with water-pots, ſome full and others empty: his word was <hi>Los llenos de dolar ylos vazios de Speranſa,</hi> and entreated him to make it as ſpeedily as was poſſible. Now ſhee knew the combate which the King had granted unto <hi>Lucidan,</hi> in caſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7258:91"/>
               <hi>Liſander</hi> did not appeare within three weeks, or ſome other for him: which ſhe beleeving he would not do, conſidering the ingagement of his new love, did reſolve to fight with him for <hi>Liſander,</hi> whom ſhe accounted her enemy, certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to die in the fight, and cauſe therby ſorrow and griefe unto <hi>Lucidan</hi> for killing of her, in thinking to kill <hi>Liſander,</hi> and make <hi>Liſander</hi> repent that ever he had left her, ſeeing that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had deſpiſed her, and betrayed her, yet ſhe would loſe her life for him: All being fantaſticke paſſions of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, blinded with love and jealouſie.</p>
            <p>Now let us make a ſteppe into great Britaine, waiting for the tilting day. We left <hi>Liſander</hi> on his way thither, and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> following him ſhortly after: But to relate all things in their order: <hi>Liſander</hi> being come unto London, keeping himſelfe ſecret, cauſed Armes to be made for him of an aſhie colour, which hidde the ſparkles of a lively fire, ſpotted with <hi>Flower-de-luces</hi> of ſilver, his device was a Love tied to a pillar in the middle of a faggot, kindled by a Lady, the word was, <hi>Alwayes conſtant</hi>: his Feather was <hi>Gree de liu</hi> and white, his Coate of Armes and capariſon of his horſe <hi>Gris de liu,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with ſilver. <hi>Lidian,</hi> comming the next day to the towne, cauſed Armes to bee made of Azure colour, ſpotted with ſtarres of gold without number: his Device was a Love, holding a Dart in the mouth, an Olive branch in the hand, and having a gooſe at his feete, holding a ſtone in the bill: the word was <hi>Leale &amp; ſecreto,</hi> a deviſe which he had made in the time when <hi>Clarangeus</hi> his jealouſie made him love (no leſſe ſecretly than faithfully) his Lady <hi>Olinda</hi>: His feather was yellow and blew, his coate armour and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of his horſe was of blew Velvet embroidered with gold. The tilting was begunne before the Armes of our Knights could bee finiſhed: The Tourney was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with Launces having ſteeled and ſharpned heads, and in open field, hee who was overthrowne at the tilting, might not demand the combate with the ſword, but if they both fell unto the ground, or that after the breaking of three launces they remained unhorſed, it was granted them: If it hapned the defendants were overthrown by the aſſailants,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7258:91"/>
the victorious aſſailants muſt take the place of the vanquiſht defendants to the end of the Tourney, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue three dayes. The Prize of the Tourney was a ſword, which King <hi>Arthur</hi> had ſometime worne, for the Knight who ſhould be victor, and a Carquanet of great Pearle for his Miſtreſſe. Foure defendants, Brittaines, deſcended in ſtraight line from the famous Knights errants of the Round Table, were come within the liſts of the field in pompous and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificke ſhew: The firſt had for his device, A Sunne riſing in the Eaſt over the toppe of a mountaine, with this word, <hi>Sin occaſo.</hi> Foure divers Engines rowled after them by an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable art: The firſt was full of Muſitians, who ſung theſe Verſes in paſsing before the Scaffold where the King and the Ladies ſate.</p>

            <p>Shortly after theſe foure Knights had placed themſelves in the liſts, foure brave Turkes entred into the field, having their <hi>Dolimans</hi> upon their Armes, their <hi>Turbants</hi> upon their heads, their Launces in their hands, and their <hi>Cemeters</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their ſides, after thier manner. Their device was the Creſcent of Silver, which ſerveth them as an ordinary marke without any word. After they had made a turne about the liſts, and placed themſelves oppoſite unto the defendants, all eight ran one againſt another; their Launces couched, with their ſharpe ſteele points, they gave full in the viſers of each others Helme, the ſtaves flew in pieces, and the foure Turkes were throwne unto the ground at this firſt courſe, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pleaſure and laughter unto the Engliſh: about forty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſailants were overthrowne (to their comfort) after them, the Defendants not ſo much as loſing a ſtirrop. So all that day the Engliſh continued vanquiſhers, and ſo went tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing out of the field. The next morning, ſo ſoone as the Defendants had taken their places, two ſtrange Knights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at the other end of the liſts, whoſe onely countenances promiſed extraordinary valour: The one had redde Armes full of flames of gold, a redde Feather; the capariſon of his Horſe crimſin velvet embroydered with flames of gold: for his device he had a Love, bearing a Globe, with this word, <hi>Piufort d'atlante.</hi> The other was in greene Armour, engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with ſilver, his feather greene, his capariſon greene vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet embroydered with ſilver; his device was a Love, which overthrew a meaſure of corne, with this word, <hi>Sin meſura.</hi> So ſoone as the Defendants had ſeene them take their places, two of the foure oppoſed themſelves, and couching their Launces, came one againſt another with ſuch grace, and met vvith ſuch force, that their ſtaves breaking to their hands, the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7258:93"/>
two defendants fell to the ground, and the ſtrangers perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted their careere without moving, to the great admiration of the beholders. The two defendants remaining, ſeeing their companions overthrowne, endevoured to revenge them, ſpurring againſt the aſſailants, &amp; the aſſailants againſt them, made the braveſt encounter that had beene ſeene: but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the defendants were overthrown, leaving their place to the ſtrangers, who from being aſſailants (as they were at firſt) now became defendants. All thoſe who preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that day, were overthrowne with much leſſe reſiſtance than the firſt; And the night comming, giving an end both unto the Jouſt, and the day, the ſtrange Knights went victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous out of the field, with the ſound of trumpets, and the like ſolemnity that had accompanied the Vanquiſhers the firſt day. The King of great Brittaine, deſirous to know theſe Champions, ſent to learne their names, and of what country they were; but they humbly be ſought his Majeſty to pardon them, if they ſhewed any unwillingneſſe to make themſelves knowne untill the end of the Tournament, which being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, they would not faile to offer their moſt humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him.</p>
            <p>All this was paſt before <hi>Liſander</hi> could recover his Armes, whereat hee was deſperately inraged: but in the end, having put them on the third day, hee was the firſt in the liſt, with ſuch a brave behaviour, upon that incomparable Horſe which he had from <hi>Cloridon,</hi> that hee gave cauſe of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the Aſſiſtants. Thoſe who had formerly beheld the others, having their eyes now fixed upon him, would not vouchſafe to looke upon the other. The defendants ſeeing him come, judged by his countenance that he would cut them out more worke than all the other; and therefore (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them making choice of a ſtrong Launce) they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves to receive him: Hee in greene armour advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelfe firſt, and as a whirle-winde, in the middle of the courſe met him, who fell upon him as a tempeſt; their Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces breaking upon the viſers of their Helmes, flew into ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; the Knights perfected their career without any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which had not hapned ſince the beginning. Having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7258:93"/>
new Launces, they ranne the ſecond time, with more force and fury than they did the firſt. The bankes of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Thames ſounded with the blowes, and their cleer waters were troubled. <hi>Liſander</hi> loſt a ſtirrop, and bended towards his crupper, but the greene Knight was throwne unto the ground ſo violently, that he had much adoe to riſe, whereat a great cry was raiſed by the people. The Knight in the redde Armes, deſirous to revenge his ſhame, in whoſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hee had gotten ſo much honour, fiercely ſpurres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Liſander,</hi> who came againſt him like a Torrent. Amongſt all the Aſſiſtants there was an univerſall ſilence, without ſpeaking, without moving, or without ſtirring their eyes, which were fixed upon the Combatants: and by the Knights there was a noiſe made, and a duſt raiſed under their horſes, which darkned the aire, &amp; made the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: The Knights met with equall violence, their Launces failed not to hit right, and to breake unto their hands, and they paſſed by without being ſtirred in their ſeates, not onely in the firſt encounter, but in the ſecond and third courſe, with admiration (through the novelty of the act) doubling in the mindes of all the beholders. When they had runne their courſes, they drew out their ſwords, and if before they had witneſſed their force and nimblenes in the Jouſting, they did no leſſe in the combat. <hi>Liſander</hi> provoked that a man ſhould breake three Launces againſt him, and yet withſtand him, ſo violently ſtrooke him upon the head, and upon every part of the body, that at every blow hee brought away a peece of his Armour, with great abundance of ſparkles of fire: The other who ſaw himſelfe handled ſo rudely, kindled his courage out of ſhame and deſpite, and his force encreaſing with his rage, doubling ſtrength upon ſtrength, and blow upon blow, hee covered the ground with peeces of <hi>Liſanders Vambraſes</hi> and <hi>Taſſes.</hi> Horrour ſeized upon the mindes of the beholders, which made their faces looke pale, and the Combatants in theſe fearefull motions, endevour to ſhew themſelves grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſtronger than two men can bee: Two houres this cruell combate laſted, without any reſt taken betweene them, and their horſes were couered with duſt and ſweat all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7258:94"/>
over their bodies, and blood in many places (although pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding but from ſleight wounds) when <hi>Liſander</hi> feeling his adverſaries forces begin to faile, rained backe a ſteppe or two, and ſaid thus unto him: Knight, your valour is equall (at the leaſt, but I have more Fortune; ſeeing that ſhe is contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and favourable unto me, content your ſelfe with that proofe which you have witneſſed both of your noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſtrength: our combate is not to death, and I ſhould be ſorry, that ſo brave and valiant a Gentleman ſhould loſe his life, which in all places elſe I would preſerve with the hazzard of mine owne. Willingly yeeld what you cannot have by force, and bee not ſorrowfull that you give place ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fortune than unto vertue. Whatſoever you are (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the other) you have a great deale of courteſie, but no leſſe preſumption, to thinke to oblige mee to that by your tongue, unto which you cannot reduce mee by your ſword. And not to flatter you long in this vaine hope, doe not thinke that I will quit the honour of this Tourney but with my life, nor my life without dearely ſelling it. I thought to doe you a pleaſure (replied <hi>Liſander</hi>) but ſeeing my courteſie offends you, wee will ſpeake of it no more. Then began they with more fury and violence than before, and by the cruelty of this ſecond charge, they wiped away the aſtoniſhment of the firſt: But in little time it was plainely ſeene, that the Knight of the redde Armes grew heavie, and although he did his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt endeavour, and witneſſed as much courage and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as his adverſary; yet his nimbleneſſe began to faile with his ſtrength, and <hi>Liſanders</hi> valour appearing advantageable above his, made it ſeene that the victory (after it had hung in an equall ballance untill then) together with the glory of the combate (the Prize) would fall unto him: Which the King ſeeing, and not willing that the victory ſhould bee bloodied with the death of ſo good a Knight, nor the feaſt fouled with ſo tragicke an action, commanded them to bee ſeparated by the Judges, appointing two nevv prizes beſides the firſt: The one for the foure defendants, vvhich had vanquiſhed the firſt day; and the ſecond for the other two, leaving the third for <hi>Liſander,</hi> if he were not vanquiſhed before night by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7258:94"/>
which was thought impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe contrary to every bodies opinion (that after the proofe of ſuch invincible valour no man durſt oppoſe ſo ſtrong an adverſary) a ſtrange Knight entred into the place, who by the richneſſe of his Arms, the goodneſſe of his horſe, and the comely preſence of his perſon, renewed againe the attention and ſilence in all the multitude: his Armes were azure with ſtarres of gold. Now you muſt underſtand that this was <hi>Lidian,</hi> who comming laſt to London, could not get his Armour finiſhed before toward the end of the laſt day, whereat he had ſuffered great impatience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Liſander</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on the other ſide of the field, newly come from the Judges, who had parted him from the Knight with the red Armes, and had left him alone defendant: When <hi>Lidian</hi> ſaw him, he went ſoftly unto him, where perceiving his Armour broken, his Horſe in a ſweat, and himſelfe in blood iſſuing from ſleight wounds, hee ſpake in this manner unto him, Knight, it is my great griefe that fortune hath occaſioned me any fighting with you this day, you but newly comming out of a great fight, which I ſee you have made, and I freſh, having done nothing: But, if it pleaſe you to joine unto my prayer, wee will humbly entreat the King to deferre it unto another time, when you may have more meanes to defend your ſelfe, and I more glory in aſſaulting you. Knight (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Liſander</hi>) your courteſie binds me to eſteeme of your valour, for they ordinarily follow one the other, as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow doth the body; and hardly ſhall you finde a courteous man who is not valiant, or a valiant man who is not courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But I thanke God, I am not in ſo weake a plight that I ſhould bee conſtrained to receive your advice, neither doe I thinke it fit to entreat the King to revoke a generall law for two particular men; wherefore, if you pleaſe, we will obey the law of the Tourney, and preſently end the controverſie of the prize, which fortune hath taken from ſo many, to give together with the victory of this day, unto one of us twaine. Be it as you pleaſe (replied <hi>Lidian</hi>) but I wiſh you leſſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried than you are, that I might enter with leſſe advantage: Saying this, hee turned his horſe, and being gone a ſpace ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7258:95"/>
for his Careere, hee came againſt <hi>Liſander</hi> with that fierceneſſe, that their ſtaves breaking into ſhivers, they met horſes and bodies with ſuch extreme force, that they went all unto the ground: <hi>Liſanders</hi> good horſe, which had runne ſo many courſes, and ſuffered ſo long and ſo violent a combat, was nevertheleſſe ſo vigorous, that hee preſently roſe againe, ſcarcely ſetting his crupper unto the ground, and <hi>Liſander</hi> had alſo roſe with him, or rather had not fallen; for he loſt not his ſaddle, but the girths (with the ſtrength of the blow) brake and left the ſaddle between his legges, whereat all the people cryed <hi>Lucifer</hi> was fallen: <hi>Lidian</hi> hee was in worſe plight, for his horſe tumbled upon one ſide, and he of the other ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that <hi>Liſander</hi> was already with his ſword in his hand, before hee was come againe to himſelfe; yet hee got up, and both of them kindled with deſpite and ſhame, began the fierceſt combate that had beene ſeene during the Tourney, <hi>Liſander</hi> being as freſh as if hee had not ſtruck one ſtroke all the day. <hi>Lidian</hi> could not thinke that he was any other than a Devill, or elſe inchanted, he ſeemed ſo unfatigable in his Armes; and all the Aſsiſtants, who had ſeene him endure ſo long with ſo much violence, thought as much: But <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> thinking that hee had to doe with Engliſh, could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admire the Engliſh Knights bounty, and did beleeve that what had beene ſaid of the Knights of the Round Table, was nothing in reſpect of the truth, having never in his life received ſuch violent encounters as of thoſe three Knights, whom he did thinke to be iſſued from their blood. The red Knight, and the greene Knight were both of them retired up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſide, no leſſe angry againſt <hi>Liſander,</hi> than wondring at his proweſſe; and admiring alſo <hi>Lidians,</hi> could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine who thoſe Knights ſhould be, who with ſo much force and nimbleneſſe debated for the Prize which they had loſt. In the meane time our two Combatants laid ſuch blowes one upon the other, as if it had beene two hammers upon an Anvill: the iron made a horrible noiſe upon their Armour, yet neither of them was aſtoniſhed at their owne danger, wherewith others were amazed. <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſeeing the day paſſe, and fearing, the night comming, they ſhould depart the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7258:95"/>
field with equall honour, redoubled his ſtrokes upon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and made him feele them more heavie, and more ſpeedy than before. <hi>Lidian,</hi> finding that his adverſary was fiercer in his ſtrokes, and that his force ſeemed to encreaſe with his labour; uſed his utmoſt power, ſtriketh, thruſteth, preſſeth him on all ſides: they were like waves againſt a rocke which could not be moved. In the meane time the Sun (it may be) frighted with the horribleneſſe of this combate, hid himſelf in the ſea, aſtoniſhing the Nymphs with relating the wonders which he ſaw in this Tourney. Then <hi>Liſander,</hi> deſpiting at <hi>Lidians</hi> long reſiſtance, gave him ſo violent a thruſt upon the Gorget, that piercing both Gorget and Curas it entred even unto the skin, and doubling a ſtroke upon the top of his Helmet, made him fall with his hands and knees unto the ground, and the Caske off from his head.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as the two Knights in the red and green armours ſaw <hi>Lidian</hi> barefaced without his caske, they knew him, and thinking that <hi>Liſander</hi> would make uſe of that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they put themſelves betweene to hinder him, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that <hi>Lidian</hi> roſe againe. But <hi>Liſander</hi> knowing him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and being as it were ſorry for the victory, in reſpect he had handled him ſo roughly, deſired rather to loſe the prize of the Tourney, than to diſcover himſelfe, thinking that in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence it could not be judged but unto <hi>Lidian,</hi> who had laſt fought for it; wherefore in putting up his ſword, he ſaid unto him, Knight, I ought to have knowne you by your valour, before I ſaw your face, and willingly quitted that unto you, which I am conſtrained unto by your victory: enjoy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore peaceably the prize of your vertue, which I honour, and beleeve, that I have both ſorrow for oppoſing you, and a great deſire to ſerve you. This ſaid, without ſtaying for an anſwer from <hi>Lidian,</hi> who was almoſt raviſhed at this exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive courteſie, he quickly got upon his horſe, and turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be gone: but <hi>Lidian</hi> running after him, ſtayed him by his coate armour, ſaying unto him, God forbid, Sir, that you ſhould vanquiſh me both in courteſie and ſtrength, or that I ſhould triumph for a victory due unto you; for Gods ſake doe me not this ſhame, in refuſing your owne glory. While
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7258:96"/>
they were in theſe termes, the Judges of the field came, and all the multitude deſiring to know what paſſed between them, came round about, ſo that <hi>Liſander</hi> could not paſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alighting from his horſe, I proteſt (ſaith he) againſt the violence you doe me, and that I doe onely ſtay to accompany you in your triumph, and in taking off his Caske made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowne. It is not poſſible to expreſſe <hi>Lidians</hi> joy and admiration: Ah brother, ſaid he, will you thus hide your ſelfe from me who honour you as I doe? Will you flye from him who ſearcheth you over the world? With theſe words <hi>Lidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> held him faſt embraced, when the other two Knights, who in the beginning were approached unto them, pulling off their Helmets, made themſelves knowne for <hi>Berontus</hi> and <hi>Alcidon,</hi> who embracing ſomtime the one, and ſomtime the other, the contentment and wonder of this happy mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting doubled. The Judges with much labour interrupting their embracings, had them all foure unto the King, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to fruſtrate <hi>Liſander</hi> of the prize due unto his vertue, gave him a ſword by the Prince of Wales, and a rich collar by the Princeſſe: and willing alſo to acknowledge <hi>Lidians</hi> valour, as alſo <hi>Alcidons</hi> and <hi>Berontus,</hi> ſent them three armors of an excellent goodneſſe, with three of the beſt Horſes in his ſtable. As for the foure Engliſh which had vanquiſhed the firſt day, he alſo, according to the great bounty of his minde, richly rewarded them: But knowing that <hi>Liſander</hi> was in ſome diſfavour in the Court of France, and deſiring to draw unto his ſervice a man of his eminent valour, offered him a penſion of a thouſand pounds ſterling; yet <hi>Liſander</hi> refuſed his offer as well as hee had done the Arch-Dukes, excuſing him upon the ſame reaſons which hee had done unto his Highneſſe. After being brought with triumph to the Palace with the King, they paſt away the evening amongſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of great Brittaine, who for beauty and noble courteſie beare away the prize from all the Ladies in the world. <hi>Lidian</hi> telling <hi>Liſander</hi> the neceſsity of his affaires, and how much hee was deſired in France, they tooke their leave of the King and Queen that night, and generally of all the Court, leaving both a great ſorrow for their departure, &amp; an incomparable
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7258:96"/>
reputation of their valour. The next morning riſing early, they went all from the Court, and imbarking themſelves at the neereſt port, they ſet ſaile for Callis: and although by all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens they were threatned with a violent ſtorme, yet <hi>Liſanders</hi> impatience was ſo great, that whatſoever the Mariners ſaid, and what token ſoever of foule weather they marked, hee would not abide untill it was paſt. We will leave them paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſtraight betweene England and France, and returne unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who having got armour ſome ten dayes before the three weekes were expired which were given unto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> one evening armed her ſelfe from head unto foot, and onely with one Lackey which her Hoſte had procured unto her, ſhe rid from Paris to lye at Suren, from whence the next morning ſhee ſent a letter of challenge unto <hi>Lucidan,</hi> of this ſubſtance.</p>

               <hi>Lucidan</hi> having given the Lackey this anſwer, entred into a deepe imagination who this Knight ſhould bee, who not reſpecting the Kings diſpleaſure, defied him with ſo much daring; ſometimes hee thought it was <hi>Lidian,</hi> who would not diſcover himſelfe in reſpect of the agreement betweene them, and ſometimes hee thought it was <hi>Liſander</hi> himſelfe, who would prevent the time appointed, and make a private duell of a combate which ought to be publicke. But <hi>Caliſta,</hi> finding by his anſwer that fortune conſtrained her to keepe her life, which ſhee would ſo willingly loſe; confirmed her ſelfe more than ever in her deſpaire, and not knowing where to ſpend the eight dayes which with ſo much ſorrow ſhe had left to ſee the light of the Sunne, determined to retire her ſelfe unto Longchampe amongſt the religious women untill the day of the combate, curſing <hi>Lucidan</hi> that he had not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted this challenge, although that ſhe greatly (in her heart) commended his diſcretion, who wanted neither courage nor judgement in his young yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As ſhee was going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Longchampe, having already given her helmet unto her Lackey, ſhe ſaw upon the way towards Paris a man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in great haſte: preſently ſhe had a conceit to go neare him, which ſhee no ſooner thought but did, and inſtantly knew him, although hee were in other faſhion than when ſhee laſt ſaw him. It was the Porter who had delivered her out of the Caſtle at Paris, whom <hi>Liſander</hi> had ſent into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy unto her (as wee have formerly ſaid) then when hee went into England: Hee came at this time from Bellaire, where not finding <hi>Caliſta,</hi> hee went to Paris, where he was told he ſhould heare of her at <hi>Olinda</hi>'s. When he ſaw <hi>Caliſta</hi> in Armour he knew her not, but ſhe (not knowing that hee dwelt with <hi>Liſander</hi>) called him by his name, and uſing him with a great deale of courteſie, offered to acknowledge

with all her power the ſervice which he had done her. The Porter (aſtoniſhed both with wonder and joy, to finde her whom hee ſought for, when hee leaſt looked for it, as alſo at her being armed) made her alſo marvell more, when he gave her <hi>Liſanders</hi> letter; her lively colour bluſhed in her cheekes, and fledde away incontinently: her knees trembled, and her horſe bridle fell out of her hands, and likely herſelfe alſo to fall unto the ground, ſtrucken with aſtoniſhment at ſo unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for newes, and with the griefe which the memory of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> made her feele.

                  <p>ONely death can ſhew you, that the ſeparation from my ſoule, is not ſo unſupportable as my being divided from you: but the intereſt you have in my life, makes mee carefull to preſerve it, becauſe I would not deprive you of the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power you have over it, and leſſen the number of your creatures by my loſſe: The cauſe of my Martyrdome leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the paine; for although it be without example, and that my paſſion is neither capable of counſell nor remedy, yet it is a ſweet imagination that I ſuffer for you, and the image of your beauty (which is the onely preſent object of my mind) maketh my torment eaſie, and withall maketh mee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, it is both juſt and reaſonable that I ſuffer the extreameſt griefe in the world for the moſt excellent beauty: let mee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the reſt in ſilence, ſeeing my words will rather leſſen my conceits than expreſſe them.

            <p>Ah diſloyall creature (ſaid ſhee in reading this letter) with what cunning doeſt thou diſguiſe the perfidiouſneſſe of thy heart? theſe words, her deep ſighes, and warme teares, which like great pearles rowled over the roſes of her cheekes, eaſily let the Porter know, that there was jealouſie in her paſsion, which made him ſay unto her, I am ſorry, Madam, that I have brought you ſuch ill newes to afflict you, and doe no leſſe wonder why <hi>Liſander</hi> ſhould uſe mee in this buſineſſe, ſeeing that next after God, there is nothing in the world which I doe reverence ſo much as your image. Are you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Liſander,</hi> ſaid ſhe? Yea, Madam, anſwered he, ever ſince he delivered me out of the hands of the Marſhals men, who were carrying mee to Paris, where without his helpe I ſhould have beene made a pitifull ſpectacle. Then he told how <hi>Liſander</hi> had delivered him (as you have heard.) Friend (replied <hi>Caliſta</hi>) you ſerve a man who of all men in the world doth beſt acknowledge ſervices done unto him, and who doth more for all them who deſerve of him. I would to God, he were as good a ſervant as he will be a good Maſter, but unto me he is the vileſt Traytor that ever was: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, hee hath beene the loſſe of mine honour, out of the love which hee hath borne mee, and by his perfidiouſneſſe hee will alſo be the loſſe of my life. Madam, ſaid the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doe not ſo much wrong unto <hi>Liſanders</hi> vertue, in depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your ſelfe of the greateſt glory that a Lady of your quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can have in this life, which is to bee ſerved and adored by the moſt accompliſht Knight in the world. Then <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſaid unto him, come hither, and (if thou alſo haſt not loſt that affection which heretofore thou haſt witneſſed unto me, and if from being faithfull as thou wert, by being converſant with thy Maſter, thou art not become ſo perfidious as he) let mee conjure thee by the light of the Sunne, and by the firſt cauſer thereof, to tell me the truth: Is is not the greateſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that can bee in <hi>Liſander,</hi> not alone to abuſe mee with ſo
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7258:99"/>
many falſe proteſtations, as he hath done, but now to write me letters of love, whileſt he in his owne countrey ſerveth and loveth a new Amazon called <hi>Hippolita</hi>? It is true (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Porter) he hath ſeene this <hi>Hippolita,</hi> and is preſſed to ſerve her by all the remonſtrances and commandements which his parents may lay upon him: But I wiſh the ground may open under my feet, and ſwallow me up before you, if hee hath not left the countrey, fearing hee ſhould bee conſtrained to ſue unto her, and is now gone into England to a Tournament which is held there, with an intent to come from thence hither: From whence hee will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into Gaſcoigne untill <hi>Hippalita</hi> bee married, although next unto your beauty (which ſurpaſſeth all thoſe of your ſexe) there is none who equals her.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>Caliſta</hi> were well ſatisfied with theſe newes, yet could ſhe not put off the deſire which ſhee had to dye, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that though <hi>Liſander</hi> were innocent of the crime of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, hee was guilty of ſuſpition, which had inforced her to this diſcontented and unſeemely courſe, after which there was no joy left her to live, or bee ſeene in the world; and willingly would ſhe have confined her ſelfe within the cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Longchampe with the religious women of that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, but that ſhe thought ſhe ſhould not be received, neither would ſhee at any hand preſent her ſelfe in the habite which now ſhee wore; together alſo that not being able to ſuffer the condition of a free life being a Miſtreſſe, how was it poſſible for her to endure the ſtrictneſſe of a religious obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? All theſe things conſidered in her minde, ſhe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her ſelfe in her firſt reſolution of fighting with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> and in dying by his hands in the ſight of all the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her ſelfe of <hi>Liſander,</hi> and end her ill fortune, which had proſecuted her with that outrage: wherefore ſhee ſaid unto the Porter, ſhee would have him ſtay a while with her, that hee might witneſſe unto <hi>Liſander</hi> her actions, and that after ſhee would give him an anſwer. So retiring unto Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champe, ſhe accommodated her ſelfe as well as ſhe could in the houſe of a poore Peaſant adjoyning unto the Abbey, where having left her horſe and her armour, after dinner ſhe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7258:99"/>
went to ſee the religious women, with whom ſhe not onely ſpent this day, but eight more, which were remaining of the three weekes granted unto <hi>Liſander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Dorilas</hi> ſeeing the day for the combate granted unto <hi>Lidian</hi> approach, and hearing no newes of <hi>Liſander,</hi> and leſſe of <hi>Lidian,</hi> whom hee had ſent unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, determined in their abſence to preſent himſelfe, not ſo much for love unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> againſt whom he was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry by reaſon of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s loſſe, as becauſe he had already ingaged himſelf by his overture made before the King; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going from Clarvall unto Paris, without acquainting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body with his deſigne, hee cauſed blacke armes to bee made, taking for his device a great greene oake, ſhaken with two contrary windes; his Motto was, <hi>Tanto pui fermo quanto pui ſcoſſo,</hi> whereby he would ſhew, that the adverſities wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was aſſailed of late, had rather confirmed than ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the conſtancy of his heart. On the other part, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> underſtanding by <hi>Lidian</hi> how <hi>Liſanders</hi> affaires ſtood, and willing to ſhew the youthfulneſſe of his courage in his old yeeres, tooke his way in poſte unto the Court immediately after <hi>Lidians</hi> departure, where not finding <hi>Liſander,</hi> as he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought he ſhould, determined to enter into the combat for him againſt <hi>Lucidan</hi>: and for this cauſe he made himſelfe gray armour, almoſt of an Iron colour, in which for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had an Eagle encompaſſed with a cloud full of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and thunder, with this word in Spaniſh, <hi>Ni Matarme, ni Spantarme</hi>; By which hee would give to underſtand, that all his and his ſonnes enemies did neither feare him nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. So the appointed time for the combate being come, by three ſeverall wayes there entred into the Horſe-market, which was the royall place by the King ordained for battailes to be fought, <hi>Adraſtus, Dorilas,</hi> and <hi>Caliſta,</hi> all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely armed, &amp; mounted upon good horſes, not one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the others enterpriſe. Of the other ſide of the field en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Lucidan</hi> with the ſound of Trumpets, mounted upon a brave horſe, with an engraven Armour, having a <hi>Cupid</hi> for his device, who held armes in his right hand, and wings in his left, with this word, <hi>Ardito &amp; preſto,</hi> thereby willing to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7258:100"/>
ſignifie that he was no leſſe valiant than ready, as well in his love as in armes. Shortly after came the King, with many Princes of the blood, Peeres of France, and officers of the Crowne, whom he had made Judges of the combate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the ancient lawes and cuſtomes of the kingdome.</p>
            <p>When he was in his ſeate, the three unknowne Knights having humbled themſelves unto his Majeſty, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their faces, remonſtrated unto him that they were there, every one in particular to maintaine <hi>Liſanders</hi> honour, not onely againſt <hi>Lucidan,</hi> but againſt all others who ſhould accuſe him of diſloyaltie: Nevertheleſſe meeting all three with one intent, without knowing either of others deſigne, they humbly entreated that they three might bee ſuffered to fight againſt three others all together, and that in this reſpect <hi>Lucidan</hi> might bee permitted to chuſe three of his friends to ſecond him in this quarrell: but he unwilling to have either ſecond or third, and offering rather to fight with all three one after another, ſo long as his life ſhould laſt; the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to draw lots, which of them ſhould fight firſt; after whoſe combate, were hee either overcome or conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the other two ſhould not be received to make any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarrell concerning <hi>Liſanders</hi> innocency; thinking the one unneceſſary, and the other unreaſonable, becauſe if <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> were vanquiſhed, <hi>Liſander</hi> remained acquitted, and if he did overcome, the other ſhould remaine culpable: beſides, it were not juſt, that he ſhould expoſe himſelfe unto a ſecond combate being wearie, and it may be wounded, againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other freſh and without hurt. This equall ſentence was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe grievous unto the ſtrange Knights, who were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one (apart by himſelfe) afraid to be dsifavoured by the lot, which (although they were three) yet could favour but one: but the ſorrowfulleſt of all was <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who diſtruſting her fortune, did beleeve ſhe ſhould never receive ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as to dye in this combate, but that ſhee ſhould be ſtill reſerved unto more misfortunes. She had with her the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of whom we have ſpoken, unto whom a little before ſhe had given the anſwere which ſhee ſent unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him onely to waite the event of this day, that hee
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7258:100"/>
might report it unto <hi>Liſander</hi>; but if ſhee had knowne that the two Knights which contended with her about fighting with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> had beene the one <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and the other <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas,</hi> the one <hi>Liſanders</hi> father, and the other hers, and alſo if <hi>Dorilas</hi> had knowne that ſhe had beene his daughter <hi>Caliſta,</hi> without doubt their trouble (although extreame) would have beene much greater. When the lots ſhould be drawne to ſee which of the three ſtrangers ſhould fight with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> their names were demanded, which they being unwilling to declare, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> firſt anſwered, that he was called the Knight of the Eagle, <hi>Dorilas</hi> called himſelfe the Knight of the Oake, and <hi>Caliſta</hi> (as wee ſaid before) having a wheele invironed with buckets for her device, named her ſelfe the Knight of the Buckets. Three Billets were made with their three names, which were all put into a caske: and as a child (who was appointed to draw) was putting in his hand, there came in a fourth knight who ſtayed the drawing. Who this knight was, we will ſpeake of in another place: But now we muſt returne unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> the principall ſubject of this ſtory. We left him floating betweene Dover and Callis, with his three companions in Armes: The Sea was then troubled with winde, whereby the waves in bigneſſe being doubled, in that little ſpace they ran a dangerous fortune. At the beginning they thought it was but a blaſt, which as ſhort as violent would turne into faire weather: but the skie armed with lightning, and darkened with clouds, which brake amongſt them into violent raine and fearefull thunder, and the blaſts of this winde (which in the darkeneſſe of this ſtorme lifted them upon the waters, ſometimes unto the ſtarres, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times opening the waves in the middle, did with horrour throw them into the bottome) made them repent their raſhnes in deſpiſing the ſtorme, hoping of ſaving themſelves. The pale Pilote having for a time reſiſted this fortune, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the ſailes to bee ſtrucken, and ſtirring the helme as he ſaw occaſion, was conſtrained to abandon that alſo, ſeeing by reaſon of the noiſe which continually came from the thunder, the windes, the waters, the cryes and the confuſion which was through all the ſhip, hee was not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7258:101"/>
nor the Mariners able to obey. <hi>Liſander</hi> ſeeing both ſteerage and tackle forſaken, and the ſailes in diſorder, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting every minute to bee ſwallowed by the waves, which already filled the ſhip, endevoured to raiſe their courages; which hee ſo well effected, that every one began to ſtand to his worke, ſome to the helme, ſome to the tackles, ſome to pumpe out the water which came into the ſhip: But ſeeing that the Patron (judging the ſhip loſt) had lept into the skiffe with an intent to ſave himſelfe therein, hee leaps after him with his ſword in his hand, and ſetting it at his throat, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him with a ſpeedy death, if hee did not returne into the ſhip, and take upon him the guiding of the ſame. The Patron ſeeing death preſent it ſelfe unto him on both ſides, deſiring rather to receive it by the waves than by iron, promiſed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him; but as hee was going to returne into the ſhippe, a huge roaring wave ſtrucke againſt the skiffe with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that breaking the cords wherewith it was held, it was preſently driven away, that they in the ſhip could never more ſet eye upon it. He who was able to expreſſe <hi>Liſanders</hi> griefe, was no bad Orator: he was ready then to effect what he had threatned againſt the Pilot, and if he had not uſed his skill, I know not what hee would have done; but his friends ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was no leſſe, beleeving certainly that he was caſt away, ſo ſuddenly they had loſt the ſight of the skiffe amongſt the waves.</p>
            <p>After this unhappy accident, <hi>Neptune</hi> (as ſatisfied with this revenge, &amp; contented to have puniſhed thoſe audacious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had raſhly contemned his power, by <hi>Liſanders</hi> loſſe) ſhewed himſelfe leſſe terrible, by little and little appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the fearefull motions of his Empire. The skie waxed cleere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſea calme, and the windes having ſtrove all day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the waves, now retired into their dennes, leaving in ſome reſt the miſerable ſhip, who all broken with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, in the end came to Callis, having beene a whole ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers day, making a three houres voyage with a good wind. Then did <hi>Lidian, Alcidon,</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> (who now had alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his opinion conceived againſt him for his brothers death) renew their complaints for <hi>Liſanders</hi> loſſe, eſpecially
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7258:101"/>
when they ſaw his Armes, his Horſe, his rich Sword, and the collar which hee had gained at the tilting, reſolving to keepe them ſafe untill they could heare more certain newes of him, and ſtaying only one night at Callis, the next morning very early they tooke their way towards Paris, hoping to be there at the day of <hi>Lucidans</hi> combate, with whom every one of them had a particular deſigne to fight in <hi>Liſanders</hi> quarrell: who then being in the skiffe alone with the Pilot ran a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune all that day, and the next night toſſed upon the waves at the pleaſure of the windes, through the darkneſſe of the night, in the greateſt miſery that ever he had ſeene. The day following, the light appearing, the aire being cleere and the ſea quiet, they were carried upon an Iland which the Pilot knew to be Gerſey, where landing with great danger, in a place amongſt cragged and deſert rocks rarely frequented by any man, they found a young Hermite, who (not ſeeing them) complained ſo loud, that they eaſily heard all his lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which you ſhall underſtand in order after we have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the memorable combate which about that time was fought in the moſt famous City, and before the greateſt King in the world.</p>
            <p>We left three Knights pretending all to fight with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> with great impatience expecting him whom fortune ſhould chuſe for that purpoſe, when a fourth entring into the field, ſtayed the childes hand, as he would have drawne the lot out of the Caske: This Knight was mounted upon a Spaniſh Jennet as white as milke, his Armes alſo were white, having for his device a naked <hi>Cupid,</hi> which paſſed through Pikes, Launces, Swords and Darts, with this word, <hi>Spreſoogin riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio,</hi> by which hee made knowne that there was no danger which hee did not deſpiſe to follow his end. After hee had humbled himſelfe before the King, without diſcovering himſelfe more than any of the others, he made it known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that having more intereſt in this combate than any of thoſe who had preſented themſelves, he required, if not to be preferred, at the leaſt to be put to the caſting of lots with the reſt; which being granted him, and having called his name <hi>Liſanders</hi> Knight, it was put into the Caske with the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7258:102"/>
other, where having beene ſhaken together, every one expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with great unquietneſſe unto whom fortune would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe the battell. It was wondred at by all when the childe drew forth the Knight named <hi>Liſanders</hi> Knight, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme griefe and ſorrow of the other three, whom the Judges cauſing to depart the field, and having equally (for advantage of ſome) placed the combatants, the Trumpets gave the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the battell, and the Knights ſpurring their horſes and couching their ſtaves, met with ſuch fury, that their launces breaking; flew into pieces, and their horſes aſtoniſhed with the blow, ſet their cruppers unto the ground, from whence with bridle and ſpurre being raiſed, they bravely perfected their careere without advantage; and ſetting their hands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſwords, began a combate no leſſe ſtrange for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, than admirable for the combatants valour. <hi>Lucidan,</hi> who was eſteemed (and juſtly) one of the beſt Knights in France (and conſequently of the world) ſtriking his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſometimes with the edge, and ſomtimes with the point, made him bend ſometime to his horſe necke, and ſometime backe upon the crupper. The other who gave not place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, preſsing upon him with ſtrokes like a fury, made him alſo ſwerve ſometimes upon one ſide, then upon the other, with the geſture and motions of a man falling unto the ground: yet he held firme, and when he was thought to fall, he recovered himſelfe with more vigour and ſtrength, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his adverſary to many great extremities. Thus the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, without advantage, was continued the ſpace of two houres before they ſtayed to breathe: while they thus reſted themſelves, they looked one upon another through their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers in great fury, themſelves being beheld by all the aſsiſtants in great admiration, who expected the end, uncertaine and doubtfull unto which of them the victory would happen. But above all, the faire <hi>Caliſta, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was about foure of the clock in the afternoone, when three unknowne Knights entring into the field, and paſsing through all the multitude, went to doe their reverence to the King, of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7258:102"/>
whom one of them craving leave to ſpeake, ſaid in this manner (a generall ſilence being amongſt the multitude, and a generall attention unto his words, out of curioſity of the novelty) Sir, theſe two Knights who are here fighting, have entred into this combate rather out of paſſion, the one deſiring to revenge his kinſmans death, the other to ſerve his friend, than out of any certaine reaſon which they have; both of them grounding their actions upon the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they have of thoſe for whom they are armed. There is none in France but my ſelfe and one Knight more (who I thinke is not here now) that can cleere your Majeſty in this action, and maintaine unto <hi>Lucidan</hi> with certainty, that <hi>Liſander</hi> killed <hi>Chriſantes</hi> and <hi>Cloridon</hi> like a valiant Gentleman: for I knew it from <hi>Chriſantes</hi> himſelfe, who told it unto me at his death, being gone out with <hi>Leon</hi> (who is the abſent Knight of whom I ſpake) to part them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found him even upon the point of death, with the loſſe of his arme, he had onely the power to tell me ſuccinctly the combate, and afterwards gave up the ghoſt, commending his enemies vertue, and blaming <hi>Cloridons</hi> paſſion and their evill cauſe, for which both of them loſt their lives: and of this, Sir, <hi>Leon</hi> whereſoever he is to be found, will be my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and many other perſons unto whom the very ſame day I made the relation, although I was not then, nor have been ſince any great friend unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> in regard of ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which have miſchievouſly fallen out: But my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Sir, obligeth mee to utter this truth, and my honour bindeth me to maintaine it, not onely thereby to preſerve the reputation of an honeſt man, but alſo to ſave the lives of theſe two Knights, who labour no leſſe raſhly than honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to kill one the other. But if your Majeſty will yeeld the combate to any man for <hi>Liſander,</hi> it is to be granted unto me, Sir, who ſpeake out of knowledge, and who eſteeme <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidan</hi> ſo brave and ſo noble a Knight, that hee will not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſay the contrary.</p>
            <p>By this diſcourſe you may eaſily know that this Knight was <hi>Berontus,</hi> and the other two <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Lidian,</hi> whom wee lately left upon their way from Callis towards Paris,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7258:103"/>
with an intent to fight with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> but ſeeing themſelves prevented, they uſed this meanes to ſeparate them. Upon this propoſition of <hi>Berontus,</hi> the King cauſed the Judges of the field to aske <hi>Liſanders</hi> Knight, upon what ground he had enterpriſed this fight. Hee anſwered to maintaine <hi>Liſanders</hi> honour. It was againe demanded of him what proofe hee had of his innocency. Unto which hee anſwered, none but the glory of his former actions. The ſame Judges asked <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidan,</hi> what aſſurance hee had of the murder which hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Liſander</hi> had committed. Hee anſwered, none, but that hee would hazzard his life to revenge <hi>Chriſantes</hi> his death. Theſe words agreeing with <hi>Berontus</hi> his ſpeech, the King declared <hi>Liſander</hi> (to the contentment of the whole company) innocent of the pretended murders, and alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from <hi>Cloridons</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes</hi> death, and impoſed a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence concerning that unto <hi>Lucidan</hi> for ever, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding him to embrace, not onely the Knight who combated, but alſo the other three who had offered to fight with him. <hi>Lucidan</hi> witneſſing as much obedience to the Kings command, as he had ſhewed violence to revenge his Kinſmans death, put up his ſword, and putting off his Caske, with open armes went to embrace him, whom lately hee endevoured to kill; who unwilling alſo to give place in courteſie, put up his ſword, and pulling off his helmet, goodly treſſes of haire fell about his ſhoulders almoſt to the heeles, which with new admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the world, made them all ſee that this maſculine courage, and more than manly ſtrength, proceeded from a woman.

to ſalute her with ſo much joy, that I am not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it. Afterwards knowing one the other, they both took her, one by one hand, and the other by the other, and went with her to doe their reverence unto the King, who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and <hi>Lidian,</hi> although hee had been angry with him, knowing that it was the faire <hi>Hippolita,</hi> who, with ſo gentle a courage, had undertaken to fight ſo dangerous a combat in <hi>Liſanders</hi> behalfe, gave her the beſt entertainment, and did her all the honour hee could deviſe, with commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations as glorious as the party that ſpake them was great: <hi>Hippolita</hi> humbly demanded his hands to kiſſe, but the King with a grace truly royall, ſaid, Rather (excellent maid) ſhould I kiſſe your hands, which either by love or force will make all the world doe homage unto them: And ſo preſenting her unto the Queene, he ſaid, See here another Amazon, whoſe beauty ſhameth the faireſt, and her valour the braveſt of this age. Heretofore you have heard how Knights have fought to defend the honour of Ladies, but now you ſee Ladies fight for Knights: Whileſt hee yet ſpake, <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> having pulled off their Helmes, did their reverence unto his Majeſty, who rejoycing amongſt ſo many good Knights, wondred to ſee <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and <hi>Dorilas</hi> undertake this combat. But <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſeeing her father, her brother, and her other friends diſcovered without their Helmes, and learning by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report which ſpread it ſelfe through the aſſembly, that the Knight which had fought againſt <hi>Lucidan,</hi> was <hi>Hippolita</hi> her Rivall, out of jealouſie of whom ſhe was brought unto this deſpaire, and that for <hi>Liſanders</hi> ſake ſhee had undertaken this combate, conſidering her love unto him, and that which hee was tyed to render againe to her beauty, grace, nimbleneſſe, courage and ſtrength, wherein ſhe gave place unto none; and ſeeing alſo the infinite kindneſſe wherwith <hi>Adraſtus</hi> uſed her, and the countenance wherewith ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſhe received them, ſhe upon all theſe appearances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the firſt report of <hi>Liſanders</hi> infidelity was true, and the treacherous excuſes of the Porter falſe, wherefore now ſhe thought her ſelf more miſerable and wretched than ever.

            <p>In the meane time the King turning to <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> ſaid, Me thought there was a third, who came with you to fight with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> what is become of him?

But why haſt thou not thy armes about thee, to maintaine that which thou counſelleſt? now will I ſhew thee unto whom thou addreſſeſt thy ſelfe, and before thee kill my ſelfe, to the end that the griefe and horror of thy having been the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may torment thee all thy life. Saying this, ſhee pulled off her Cask, &amp; tranſported with fury, ſhe drew out her ſword: but <hi>Alcidon</hi> catching her in his armes, ſaid thus unto her: Madam, pardon me (if it pleaſe you) this invention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I have beene conſtrained to flye, thereby to make you diſcover your name, ſeeing you reſolved to hide your ſelfe from mee. It is true that the King hath ſent after you, and if you turne not your ſelfe out of the way, you will ſee him but too ſoone: not that he doth thinke you are <hi>Liſander,</hi> not that any body hath told him ſo, and leſſe, that hee hath any intent to marry him unto <hi>Hippolita</hi>; but I my ſelfe have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived it, knowing by the Porter whom you had yeſterday with you, the pitifull miſery into which (by the falſe report made unto you of <hi>Liſander</hi>) you were brought. Wretch as thou art (anſwered <hi>Caliſta</hi>) hold thy peace, art thou not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to thinke I ſhould bee ſuch a Sot, as to beleeve any word that ſhould proceed out of thy mouth, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe the contrary of what thou even now toldeſt me, and what I have ſeene? Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> what you have ſeene doth not prove that true which you beleeve; what I have ſaid of the King, in part I have deviſed it, and of that which I have ſaid of the Porter, you your ſelfe may judge of the truth, if it bee but by the direction which hee hath given me of this place, whither you were retired, which I ſhould have beene no more able to finde, than a great many others who are now a ſeeking you: whereby you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gather, I knew you when I ſpake unto you, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7258:106"/>
your helmet was off, as ſince: but as for that which hath beene told you concerning <hi>Liſander,</hi> it is abſolutely falſe, that ever he had ſuch a thought, as <hi>Lidian</hi> &amp; <hi>Berontus</hi> can equally witneſſe with mee, for all foure of us came out of England together, and hee had beene here with us now, if the ſea, the winde, and a ſtrange accident had not joyned together to our parting. <hi>Berontus</hi> loves him no more than he loves you, neither doe I: and if both our teſtimonies were ſuſpected, yet your brothers ought not to bee ſo, whom I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bring with me, or to ſay any thing unto him, or unto <hi>Dorilas,</hi> of what the Porter had told mee, beleeving that as you have done me the honour alwaies confidently to aſſure your ſelfe upon my friendſhip, you would rather commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate your paſſion to me, than unto any of them: See now if there be any appearance in this diſcourſe, and if you thinke not, turne againſt me the point of your ſword, which I had rather feele through my heart, than once thinke to offend you. <hi>Alcidon</hi> unto the ſtrength of theſe reaſons, added the diſcourſe of what had happened in England, how <hi>Liſander</hi> after a long combate againſt <hi>Berontus, Lidian</hi> and himſelfe, had gained the prize of the combate, which was a ſword of an ineſtimable value, and a collar of admirable beauty and riches, which was deſtined unto her: Finally, how being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked to come into France, and how entring into the skiffe to force the Pilot backe unto the charge of the ſhip, a wave had unfortunately ſeparated them (as you have heard.) And that theſe things are true (ſaid hee) beſides the witneſſes which I have named unto you, the ſword and the collar are now at Paris, in <hi>Lidians</hi> hands, with <hi>Liſanders</hi> horſe, armes, and footman, from whom you may draw more particular proofe of this diſcourſe, although none more true, nor none more certaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caliſta,</hi> vanquiſhed with theſe reaſons, knew not what to ſay, nor what to doe, onely with folded armes ſhe begged pardon, and intreated him to counſell her, converting her firſt fury into pitifull bewailings of hers and <hi>Liſanders</hi> hard fortune. The beſt counſell I can (for the preſent) give you, ſaid <hi>Alcidon,</hi> is to leave theſe armes, which will (in ſtead of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7258:107"/>
hiding you) eaſily make you knowne, and untill ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be found, retire your ſelfe into this Abbey; the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whereof is my Kinſwoman, and when ſhee ſhall know your condition, ſhee will not bee wanting to yeeld you the honour and entertainment which you deſerve: you ſhall live there (at the leaſt) free from being found, for no men come there, and although they ſhould, it will bee leſſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to be found in a Covent amongſt religious women, than armed in a field. In the meane time I will treate with <hi>Lidian,</hi> how to bring about that <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Otranta</hi> may ſee you, who will be as glad to know that you are here in this Abbey, as they are ſorry and deſolate becauſe they cannot tell where you are. This counſell being approved by <hi>Caliſta,</hi> ſhe left armes, horſe and man in her lodging, and in her cloak and her ſword ſhe went unto the Abbeſſe with <hi>Alcidon,</hi> unto whom they needed not ſay any more, but that ſhe was <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta.</hi> The Abbeſſe wondring, yet glad that ſhe had power to oblige ſuch a Lady, received her with admirable content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with as much demonſtration of love as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. <hi>Alcidon</hi> returnes directly to Paris, and finding <hi>Lidian</hi> ready to goe in queſt of his ſiſter, told him, that hee would beare him company, if he would goe firſt and ſee the Ladies which were at Clarvall; whereunto hee willingly agreeing out of a deſire to ſee his deare <hi>Olinda, Alcidon</hi> by the way told him, how he had found <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and where hee had left her, with all which you have heard, to <hi>Lidians</hi> great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who nevertheleſſe was as glad to heare the end of her ſalley, as he was ſorrowfull to heare of the beginning. After many diſcourſes which they had together about this ſubject, they reſolved to communicate it unto the Ladies (whom they went to ſee) before they would acquaint <hi>Dorilas,</hi> who lodged together with <hi>Adraſtus</hi> at Paris, and often viſiting and courting one another, they ſwore a moſt perfect friendſhip, being both equally troubled, one with the loſſe of his ſonne, the other of his daughter.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Hippolita</hi> having left her armes, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelfe in the moſt advantageable habits of her ſexe, ſhe gave with ſuch lightning into the Courtiers eyes, that for
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7258:107"/>
one which with her ſword and a great deale of labour ſhee had vanquiſhed, ſhe had with her looks without intending it, and without contentment, captivated a hundred: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe brought great contentment unto all who beheld her, yet ſhe received none, not ſeeing him for whom ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke this voyage. One day after <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Lidians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, ſhe going unto the Louure with <hi>Adraſtus, Dorilas</hi> &amp; <hi>Lucidan,</hi> who could bee no more without her, than a Pilot ſaile without directions to the pole, there entred into the Preſence-chamber one of the Guard, bringing with him the armes which were preſently known to be the Knights, who with <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and <hi>Dorilas</hi> offered to combate <hi>Lucidan</hi>; who preſenting them to the King, ſaid thus: Sir, your Majeſty having commanded me to ſeek the Knight who wore theſe armes, I followed him to Saint Anthonies gate, by which I was told that he went; and having underſtood that he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downe by the ditch, untill he came unto Saint Honno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius his gate, taking his way from thence unto Chaliot, I followed him, alwaies inquiring of thoſe whom I met, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I came unto the Wood of Bollogne, where finding none who could tell mee which way he was gone, I ran unto all the Villages round about where I imagined he might be, as Newly, Surene and S. Cloud, without hearing any newes of him, untill this day as I was upon my returne, having now no hope to meet any body who could ſatisfie me, I met his Lackey neere Longchampe, who came to water his horſe. Knowing him, Sir, I asked for his Maſter, whom (as he told me) he had not ſeen ſince the next day after <hi>Lucidans</hi> combat, when a Gentleman came to aske for him early in a morning at a little houſe neere Longchampe where hee lay; and for proofe of what he ſaid, becauſe I did not beleeve him, hee led me into the houſe, where I found nothing but theſe Armes: I was in the Abbey which is hard by, to enquire of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous women, who were not able to tell me any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I returned backe to his lodging, and tooke his Lackey, his Horſe, and his Armes to preſent them to your Majeſty. The King called the Lackey unto him, and asked him of his Maſters name; but hee could learne no more but what the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7258:108"/>
Guard had already told him. Deſiring then to ſee the Horſe, he commanded that he ſhould be brought into the Court of the Louure, where <hi>Dorilas</hi> beholding him with a quicker ſpirit, and more earneſtneſſe than when hee ſaw him under <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and ſeeing him without any capariſon or other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture but his ſaddle, preſently knew him to be his owne, and conſequently that hee whoſe name they were in ſuch care to know, was his daughter <hi>Caliſta.</hi> It is not poſſible to expreſſe his aſtoniſhment, but by the ſame ſilence wherwith he then covered it, retyring himſelfe without ſpeaking of a word, for feare left his griefe ſhould diſcover his thought. So ſoone as he was gone unto his lodging, he went from thence unto Clarevall, where finding (contrary to his expectation) <hi>Lidian</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> amongſt the Ladies, unto whom hee had a reſolution to tell what he had heard of <hi>Caliſta,</hi> he found that they had better intelligence; wherefore in ſome proportion hee comforted himſelfe to underſtand that ſhee had retired her ſelfe into this Nunnery. <hi>Ambriſia</hi> being amongſt theſe Ladies, and knowing that <hi>Adraſtus</hi> was at Paris, entreated the company to be pleaſed that ſhe might goe ſee him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they all condeſcended, and reſolved to goe with her.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the King curious to know who the Knight of the Buckets was, commanded that the Armes ſhould be expoſed in a publike place, untill ſome one were found, who could tell newes of him who had worne them the day of the combate betweene <hi>Lucidan</hi> and <hi>Hippolita</hi>; who was then in the Lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7258:108"/>
of murdering <hi>Chriſantes</hi> and <hi>Cloridon,</hi> I moſt humbly entreat your Majeſty to ſuffer mee to defend their innocency, and to ordaine, that thoſe who ſhall accuſe him, may appeare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time aboveſaid, and proſecute their cauſe like Knights, and not with wrangling. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> being by at this intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty joyned alſo his, caſting himſelfe at the Kings feete, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſought him to have compaſſion on his age, and of the ſorrow which hee might have for a ſonne, ſuch as <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was, conjuring him with teares that hee might ſecond <hi>Hippolita</hi> in this enterpriſe. <hi>Veraſcus</hi> was not then at the Court, who would have beene much offended at <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s words: but <hi>Berontus</hi> who in ſhew ſhould bee obliged to undertake the anſwer in <hi>Veraſcus</hi> his abſence, as well for the neerneſſe between them, as for the intereſt he had, being next kinſman to the dead, ſtood nevertheleſſe ſilent, retained not only out of love to <hi>Ambriſia</hi> and reſpect which (for her ſake) he bare unto all thoſe who maintained her brothers right, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially unto <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Adraſtus</hi>; but alſo out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which the ſame <hi>Liſander</hi> had given him of the juſtice of his cauſe: Yet the King asking him if hee had any thing to anſwer againſt <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s requeſt, hee ſaid, That hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vanquiſhed with the appearances which were in his brothers murder, he had maintained that no man but <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> could doe it: but ſince having certainely knowne that at that time he was in Flanders, and that the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with <hi>Cloridon</hi> and <hi>Chriſantes</hi> he had left his ſword (bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the handle) in the field, hee would rather combate to defend him than to accuſe him: beleeving alſo that his ſiſter in law had too much honour, and too noble a heart ever to conceive a thought of ſo infamous an act. All the Court wondred at theſe words, and the King himſelfe was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and ſeeing him who had the principall intereſt in the juſtice of <hi>Cleanders</hi> death (contrary to the opinion of all the world) to inſiſt upon the innocency of the accuſed, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Hippolita,</hi> That he did permit her to keepe the armes of the unknowne Knight, in the place and upon the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required: but that hee did not grant her the combate which ſhee demanded againſt <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s accuſers,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7258:109"/>
there being no need ſince they did confeſſe them innocent, nevertheleſſe at her requeſt, he would take the hearing of the cauſe from the Judges unto his owne knowledge, and that they might both freely come unto Paris to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, hee diſpenſing with their returning into the eſtate wherein they were, and giving them the Court for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Adraſtus</hi> having humbly thanked the King, went both of them to embrace <hi>Berontus,</hi> and from thence <hi>Hippolita</hi> having brought <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s armes into the field, ſet up a Tent, neere unto which ſhe raiſed a Trophee, expecting when ſome body ſhould preſent himſelfe to queſtion them. But <hi>Adraſtus</hi> returning unto his lodging, thinking to find <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas</hi> there, to carry him the firſt newes of his happy ſucceſſe in <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s and <hi>Liſanders</hi> buſineſſe, underſtood by his Hoſte that he was gone unto Clarvall, which made him preſently diſpatch <hi>Liſanders</hi> two footmen, which <hi>Lidian</hi> had left with him, one into Normandy, the other into Britaine, to learne ſome newes of his Maſter: and he in the meane time going on horſebacke unto Clarvall with <hi>Berontus,</hi> who offering to accompany him, out of a deſire hee had to ſee <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> met her upon the way, with <hi>Dorilas, Otranta, Lidian, Olinda, Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Argire.</hi> The joy which <hi>Dorilas</hi> and all the company received at the news which <hi>Adraſtus</hi> told them, the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Ambriſia</hi> had in ſeeing her father, and which <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus</hi> had in ſeeing <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> (who thanked him for the faithfull teſtimony which he had given of <hi>Liſanders</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi>'s innocency) tempered the ſorrow which all of them had for their abſence: and to make it more perfect, they went all together unto Longchampe, not only to ſee <hi>Caliſta,</hi> but to bring her to Paris, expecting <hi>Liſanders</hi> returne, ſeeing that by the Kings clemency both the one and the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of the Juſtice, might appeare ſafely. <hi>Caliſta</hi> being advertiſed of their comming, had left her cloake and ſword, and being apparelled in the ordinary habit of her ſexe, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them with a ſhame, which did raiſe unto a higher luſtre her incomparable beauty, wherewith ſhee excelled the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which above all others aſtoniſhed <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (who had
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7258:109"/>
never before ſeene her) and made him not onely excuſe <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> but alſo thinke that hee had a great deale of reaſon to diſobey him, for which he formerly blamed him. Madam, ſaid he, in ſaluting her, I doe not now wonder if thoſe who have had the honour to ſee you, do deſpiſe all other glory: for I my ſelfe, whoſe age ought now to diſpence me from that ſervitude, whereunto you bring all the world, would not wiſh a greater good, than to be deprived from all others, to have that of your ſervice. <hi>Caliſta</hi> knowing who he was, made a great reverence unto him, ſaying, ſhee would receive theſe praiſes from him, more for the reſpect which ſhe bare him, than any wayes preſuming that ſhee could merit them: And ſeeing <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Otranta,</hi> who ſtretched out their armes unto her, ſhe kneeled at their feet, humbly entreating them to pardon her the diſpleaſure and ſorrow which ſhe had raiſed them. But they lifted her up, intreating her not to bring into their mindes a thing which might trouble the contentment which they had to finde her againe. Furthermore, ſaid <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas,</hi> thank this good Knight; for with a faire Amazon who is at Paris, and <hi>Berontus</hi> his faithfull teſtimony, which hee gave before the King of your innocency, they are all three cauſe, that without fear of any caſtle or priſon but the Court, you and <hi>Liſander</hi> may now enjoy your liberties, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore you have had in Paris, having the King himſelfe for Judge onely. <hi>Caliſta,</hi> together with the joy of this newes, felt a ſecret motion in her heart at the name of this Amazon, which wrought an alteration in her face: But <hi>Berontus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing himſelfe then with <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> whom he conducted, afterwards <hi>Alcidon</hi> with <hi>Argire,</hi> and laſt of all <hi>Lidian</hi> with <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> ſaluting her, put it from her minde for the preſent, and raiſed in her a contentment, to expreſſe which I am unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</p>
            <p>After they had a little reſted, and refreſhed themſelves within the Nunnery, and thanked the Abbeſſe and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious women, they all departed toward Paris, where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before night, they alighted at the Louure. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> led <hi>Calista, Dorilas Otranta, Alcidon Argire, Lidian Olinda,</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus Ambriſia.</hi> The King being then in the Queenes cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

they were all brought in to their Majeſties, unto whom <hi>Adraſtus</hi> preſenting <hi>Caliſta,</hi> ſpake unto the King in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sir, behold the Knight whom a deſire to juſtifie <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſantes</hi> and <hi>Cloridons</hi> death, to the end that hee might afterwards juſtifie them both for <hi>Cleanders,</hi> hath made her cover her ſelfe with blacke Armes, which your Ma<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath committed unto <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s keeping: We are not now come humbly to entreat you that they may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto her, ſhe having more power thus diſarmed, than all the Knights in the world armed; but to offer you her, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our humble ſervice, to lay her honour with out meanes, and our lives into your hands, giving you moſt humble thankes that it hath pleaſed your Majeſtie to take knowledge of our cauſe, and to entreat your Majeſty to doe her juſtice, which yet you never refuſed to any perſon. <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> having ſpoken theſe words, <hi>Caliſta</hi> kneeled down before the King, who having never ſeene her in <hi>Cleanders</hi> life (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was much retired from the Court) much leſſe ſince his death; was kindled with the lightning of this beauty, which having lifted up, and graciouſly ſaluted, he preſented her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queene, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What thinke you of this Knight, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? was it not great pity that ſuch a jewell ſhould be ſhut up in the Caſtle?

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7258:110"/>
unto her, You muſt now (faire Amazon) render the armes, or fight with this faire Lady, unto whom they doe belong. Sir, anſwered <hi>Hippolita,</hi> not onely theſe armes, but all others ought to be yeelded up unto her beauty. What ſhall then be given unto yours, ſaid <hi>Caliſta,</hi> which doth ſhine with ſo much advantage over the faireſt? I am not able to utter all the faire words which then proceeded from their faire mouthes: But what contrary thoughts were in the meane time hidde in their hearts with what different ſpirits from their outward ſhew, did theſe faire Rivalls behold one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? with what confuſion did <hi>Hippolita</hi> looke upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s incomparable beauties? with what grace, <hi>Caliſta,</hi> drawing her glaſſe ſometimes by ſtealth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to enquire of it about the victory which ſhe preſumed to have over <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s perfections? how many torments did <hi>Lucidan</hi> ſuffer between the new fires which <hi>Hippolita</hi> had kindled in his breaſt, and the lively ſparkles which having beene raked up in the aſhes of <hi>Calista</hi>'s abſence, did now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come flaming by her preſence?</p>
            <p>In the meane time night deſcending, covered with her large mantle poudered with ſtars, licenced this faire compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; every one departed contented, except <hi>Hippolita,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Caliſta</hi> conducted backe by <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> as if hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready accompted her for his daughter, deſpaired ever to bee ſo her ſelfe. All night ſhe could not ſleepe, <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s faire face, and the admirable attractions of her ſurmounting beauty ſwome in her minde, ſhee ſaw her ſelfe overcome by <hi>Caliſta,</hi> ſhe thought her ſelfe deſpiſed by <hi>Liſander,</hi> and called him trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour for ſpeaking of love unto her, being ingaged in another place, and ungratefull for leaving her for any other; then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine would ſhee excuſe him for having made ſo worthy a choice, which ſhe her ſelfe was enforced to approve. In theſe diſquiets having paſſed a great part of the night, ſhee called <hi>Erifila,</hi> and arming her ſelfe in <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s Armes, leaving her own hanging in the place, ſhe departed early in the morning, taking no leave of any body.</p>

O Love, thou art a Traitor and a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, hiding under ſuch ſweet apparances ſuch bloody and mortall effects: Poore <hi>Cleander,</hi> now reduced unto aſhes by thy deadly flame, nay rather by thy impudent flaming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: Infamous <hi>Clarinde,</hi> who haſt brought me into this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity for thy fault, curſed bee thy memory if it yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine amongſt men, and curſed be thy Ghoſt if it bee gone into Hell: Let thy body be without buriall, thy ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſt, and thy name without honour, for ever to remaine ſcandalous and opprobrious unto all the world.

Leon</hi> knowing him both by his voice and by his face, and ſeeing his ſword ſhining in his hand, and over his head, now no leſſe troubled with the apprehenſion of death, than even now weary of living, anſwered thus: It is true that I have killed <hi>Cleander,</hi> not maliciouſly, nor out of deſigne, but onely to ſave my life, with the honour of a perſon whom then I loved, and who was more deere unto me than my owne life; which you cannot thinke ſtrange, if ever you have loved: The repentance and ſorrow which I ſuffer, will (I hope) ſomething excuſe the offence, for which I would not refuſe death, if my life might not ſerve to juſtifie two perſons, of whom I beleeve you are one, without

which reſpect, I had rather leave it here, than carry it to Paris to loſe it upon a ſcaffold: but I conſider that there is another, in which wee muſt give an account for this, wherefore I ſhould bee ſorry to bury with mee <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s reputation and yours, whoſe innocency is ſo troubled, that it cannot cleerly appeare but in the confeſſion of my fault. Your reaſons are good, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> but your conſiderations are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too ſlow, and would have beene unprofitable, if ſtay had been made untill you had executed them. But better late than never, and although I doe not helpe you to obtaine your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the death of ſo deare a friend as you have killed, yet I will not hurt you, and it may be the King, according to his accuſtomed clemency and goodneſs, conſidering that it was love and neceſsity of ſaving your life, which made you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of his, will rather uſe mercy than juſtice. After ſome other diſcourſe which they had together, <hi>Liſander,</hi> without entring farther into the Ile (ſo great was his deſire to be at Paris) made him enter with him into the ſhip, and the winde being faire, and the ſea calme, they made their courſe along the Coaſt of Normandy, untill they came unto New Haven, from whence going (without any accident) unto Roane, hee was conſtrained to ſtay there to buy horſes, and armes, the richeſt that he had ever yet worne; and to witneſſe that he had rather dye in the ſight of his Lady, than ſuffer any longer the torment of his abſence, hee bare for his device, an Argent Eagle with wings ſpread and halfe burned under a Sun of gold, upon which he firmly looked with this word, <hi>Purche godon gli occhi, ardan le pinne.</hi>

But ſeeing I cannot be there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling your peace, and without making your face bluſh, I will onely endevour to learne the colour of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that I may weare it in your abſence, and thereby wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto you, that although I have not tyes enow to hold you, I have reſolution enough to let you goe, and more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in your loſſe, than I had contentment in poſſeſſing you. Doe not looke that I ſhould here accuſe you of infidelity; for herein you doe mee the moſt pleaſing ſervice that is poſſible for you, and for which I am rather to thanke you than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine: neither have you deceived mee, for the words which you have ſaid, proceeding but from an unconſtant heart, make me ſufficiently judge, that your actions muſt needs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſame lightneſſe.

            <p>The condemned man, who after a pardon vainely hoped for, ſees himſelfe led unto execution, is not more aſtoniſhed than ſorrowfull <hi>Liſander</hi> was in receiving this newes, then when he thought that all difficulties were removed, and that all things ſmiled upon him. The Porter told him three or foure times over, all the ſallies which jealouſie had inforced <hi>Caliſta</hi> to make: Firſt, how ſhe had gone from Clarevall in mans apparrell, had put her ſelfe into armes at Paris, &amp; going from thence to challenge <hi>Lucidan,</hi> had entred there againe to fight with him before the King: Actions ſo extravagant, that they muſt needs proceed from an extraordinary paſsion. And finding in her letter ſo much diſdaine and indifferency, hee could not imagine from whence ſuch unequall contrarieties ſhould ſpring. In the end comforting himſelfe in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and in the meanes which he had to ſerve his Lady, by repreſenting <hi>Leon,</hi> a principall juſtifying peece in her proceſſe; hee ſent away the Pilot with his skiffe, and the next morning earely, with <hi>Leon</hi> and the Porter, departed from Roane to finde <hi>Caliſta</hi> at Longchampe, where he yet thought ſhe was. As he was about halfe way towards Paris, having rid in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame diligence untill noone, hee met two Knights well mounted, and well armed, who came from the ſame town. They were jealous <hi>Hippolita,</hi> and her maid <hi>Erifila,</hi> who the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7258:113"/>
ſame day were departed from the Court, as you have heard, to ſearch for <hi>Liſander</hi> with the ſame paſſion which lately had ſo farre tranſported <hi>Caliſta.</hi> So ſoone as the Porter ſaw <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s armes, hee judged that it was <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told <hi>Liſander,</hi> who as ſuddenly beleeved it, as hee had a ſtrong deſire it ſhould be ſo; wherefore ſpurring his horſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly unto her, he lifted up the viſour of his Helme, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his body to the pummell of his ſaddle, in ſaluting, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with as much ſubmiſſion and humility as was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not to condemne him without hearing; ſhee eſpecially, who had proved how much it behooved thoſe who were accuſed to bee heard in their juſtifications: <hi>Hippolita</hi> knowing him, and deſirous to convince him of infidelity by his owne confeſsion, ſeeing hee tooke her for <hi>Caliſta,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to confirme him in that errour by her ſilence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing his excuſes, not diſcovering her ſelfe untill <hi>Liſander</hi> tranſported with paſsion told her, That hee had never ſeene the world otherwiſe, but that thoſe who had beſt ſerved, were worſt uſed, That for his part hee had attempted all poſsibilities for her ſervice, and effected them: neither in all the ſervices which he had done, could he ever finde himſelfe guilty of any fault, either in effect or will, That hee knew well the report which was ſpread of his love unto <hi>Hippolita,</hi> whom hee had beene conſtrained to ſee out of reverence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father; but that he could never love her, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration ſoever hee had made, or what excellencies ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were in her, which although they were great, yet were not ſuch as that they could enter into any compariſon with hers.</p>
            <p>So farre had <hi>Liſander</hi> diſcourſed, and would have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded further, beleeving that he ſpake unto <hi>Caliſta</hi>: But <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita</hi> deſpited to ſee her enemy preferred before her, and by a man who had formerly preferred her before all mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; not able to beare his diſcourſe any longer, turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her head, and powring forth teares under her Helmet, anſwered nothing, but O Traitor; which word confirmed <hi>Liſander</hi> more in opinion that ſhee was <hi>Caliſta.</hi> In the end, <hi>Hippolita</hi> deſirous to revenge her ſelfe, or to dye by his hands,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7258:113"/>
and thereby to leave him in ſorrow all his life, imagined this anſwer, which put <hi>Liſander</hi> unto extreame paine, and her ſelfe into no leſſe danger: Thou art deceived ſaid ſhe, in what thou ſaieſt, and ſhe for whom thou takeſt mee, is farre enough from hence; for know, that I am thy enemy <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> who have taken from her this horſe, and theſe armes, which thou ſeeſt upon mee, and have ſent her whither ſhee ſhall never returne. But to comfort thee, make thy ſelfe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to follow her, for I will either loſe my life, or ſend thee ſpeedily unto her, revenging the ſhedding of <hi>Chriſantes</hi> blood by thy death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liſander</hi> knew hee was deceived by <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s voice, and thinking that hee who ſpake of revenging <hi>Chriſantes</hi> death was <hi>Lucidan,</hi> hee eaſily beleeved (feare being as quick as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) that according unto his ſpeech hee had killed <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and was thereby kindled in ſuch rage, that not able to anſwer one word, hee ſet his hand unto his ſword, <hi>Hippolita</hi> having drawne hers, and ſtrucke ſuch a blow upon her Caske, that piercing it unto the skin, he wounded her ſorely in the head, and raiſed more fury in her, than ever in her life poſſeſt her; ſo that ſeeing <hi>Liſander</hi> lifting up his arme to redouble his ſtroake, ſhee directed the point of her ſword unto that place of his Armes, where his Vaunt-brace was joyned unto his Curas, and ſpurring her horſe with all her might, ſhe ranne through his arme. <hi>Liſander</hi> provoked above all that can bee imagined, to ſee himſelfe ſo ill handled by one enemy, who had bragged of killing <hi>Caliſta</hi>; as his force was doubled by his anger, ſo his anger was greater than ever it was; and as his ſtroakes were greater than ever hee had given any, ſo the reſiſtance which hee found, was greater than any that ever hee met with. Their combate could not be long, becauſe it was ſo violent, beſides, they fought more in eagerneſſe and fury, than according either to art or judgement, which in all other combates were wont to guide them; both of them loſt much blood: Whileſt <hi>Erifila</hi> beheld this pitifull ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in great diſtreſſe for the danger wherin ſhe ſaw <hi>Hippolita</hi>; and in no leſſe feare was the Porter, who in the meane time keeping <hi>Leon,</hi> according to the uſe which hee had learned in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7258:114"/>
the Caſtle, thought that God would here give ſtay unto <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanders</hi> victories and good fortune, who preferring the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of revenge before his life, and determining to end the battaile with one ſtroak, bore a point againſt <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s breſt ſo ſtraightly, &amp; with ſuch violence &amp; cruelty, that his ſword pierced the Curas, and ſliding along by one ſide, it paſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her arme pit. <hi>Hippolita</hi> reeling with this great ſtroke, he ſpurres cloſe unto her, and with his Horſe thruſt ſo violently, that ſhee fell downe unto the ground, whither he lighted in ſuch haſte, that <hi>Erifila</hi> could not ſtay him, pulls her Caske from her head, &amp; lifting up his arme to cut it off (not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing to looke upon her face) her goodly treſſes of haire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in blood, made him firſt ſee his errour, and afterwards know that the perſon whom hee intended to kill with ſo much hatred, was the faire <hi>Hippolita,</hi> who having loſt her knowledge and ſenſe, was in a ſwound in his armes. It is not poſsible to tell the leaſt part of the confuſion which was in his ſoule: hee knew not what to doe, nor what to ſay, nor what to thinke; ſometimes hee was angry with the Porter, who had made him take <hi>Hippolita</hi> for <hi>Caliſta,</hi> ſometimes hee blamed <hi>Hippolita</hi> her ſelfe, for hiding her ſelfe under the name of <hi>Lucidan,</hi> and under the pretext of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s death had given way and exacted this diſgrace: but <hi>Erifila</hi> told him, that he himſelfe was the cauſe, foraſmuch as <hi>Hippolita</hi> juſtly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, after the demonſtration of love which hee had made unto her (and the great bonds wherein ſhe had tyed him, as well in enterpriſing the voyage unto the Court, the combate with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> and now in going in queſt of him; hee had nevertheleſſe ſpoken ſo diſadvantageably of her, and had ſo highly raiſed <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s perfections before hers, and ſhee not able to ſuffer, that one who had offered ſo much love unto her; as in excuſe thereof ſhould ſay, and to her face, that hee had loved her to ſatisfie another) had upon purpoſe faigned <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s death, that the deſire of revenge might incite him to fight with her, beleeving that ſhee had killed <hi>Caliſta,</hi> and that falling under his armes as ſhee had done, ſhee might leave with him, together with the horrour of her death, an eternall ſorrow and repentance of his ungratefulneſſe and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7258:114"/>
perfidiouſneſſe. This redoubled <hi>Liſanders</hi> perplexity and aſtoniſhment, who ſeeing her loſe a great deale of blood, and loſing no leſſe himſelfe, cauſed her to be carried unto the next village, where having gotten a Surgeon with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and finding that <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s wounds were not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, he cauſed his own to be dreſſed, and then put himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine upon his way to Paris, not ſo much as taking leave of the Lady whom hee had ſo much injured, nor having the courage to aske pardon of her, whom hee had the heart (not knowing her) ſo mortally to offend, as well fearing that his preſence ſhould cauſe ſome alteration in her, as out of ſhame he had for the words which hee had ſpoken, thinking her to bee <hi>Caliſta</hi>: yet hee did intreat <hi>Erifila</hi> to excuſe his departure without ſeeing her, fearing the danger which the trouble of his ſight might bring unto her: aſſuring that he never had ſo ſenſible a ſorrow, as that which he carried with him for the offence which innocently he had done, in ſatisfaction wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was no kinde of torment or paine which hee would not undergoe to content her, and to recover the honour of her favour. Wee will now let the ſorrowfull <hi>Hippolity</hi> reſt a while, unto whom ſpeech was forbidden for feare of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and wee will follow unfortunate <hi>Liſander,</hi> who went from her no leſſe ſorrowfull than ſhe. After that hee had rid the reſt of the day meditating of that which had hapned, and the eſtate wherein he left her, together with griefe for theſe miſchiefs fallen, he arrived in the evening at Pontoiſe, which is ſome ſeven leagues from Paris, no leſſe weary and travailed in his body, than diſquieted in his minde: and, as his ill fortune did guide him, hee alighted at an Inne, the Maſter whereof was but newly come from Paris, and with him a Gentleman belonging unto <hi>Dorilas,</hi> who knew <hi>Liſander</hi> well by report, and not by ſight, although he were one of the two whom <hi>Dorilas</hi> had with him, when he was ſet upon in the forreſt of fountaine Bleau, and ſaved by the ſame <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> as you have heard in the beginning of this Hiſtory. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> who deſired ſome divertion from his thoughts, was glad to ſup in their company, where his curioſity made him intreat this Gentleman to tell him ſome newes from the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7258:115"/>
Court, who knowing none more memorable nor freſh than that whereof <hi>Caliſta</hi> had beene lately the argument, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto him what had hapned ſince the combate betweene <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Lucidan</hi>: Firſt with <hi>Alcidon,</hi> then how her armes had been brought into the Louure, and put under <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita</hi>'s guard, in the field where the battaile was fought, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they ſhould bee knowne: how <hi>Dorilas</hi> knew his horſe; and how <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Adraſtus</hi> offered to combate againſt <hi>Liſanders</hi> and <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s accuſers, for the murder of <hi>Cleander</hi>: how the King having heard <hi>Berontus</hi> his anſwer, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged them, had taken the cauſe from the Judges into his owne hearing: how <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> having carried this newes unto <hi>Dorilas,</hi> they went together with <hi>Alcidon, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and the Ladies which were with them, to find <hi>Caliſta</hi> at Longchampe, from whence they had brought her to Paris: finally, the words which had paſt before their Majeſties with <hi>Hippolita,</hi> and the contentment whereunto all things had happily ſucceeded; all which was matter of joy and comfort to <hi>Liſander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when following his diſcourſe, hee came to touch the love betweene <hi>Lucidan</hi> and <hi>Caliſta,</hi> which he took upon him to know, as being a houſhold ſervant unto <hi>Dorilas,</hi> eſpecially ſince <hi>Lidians</hi> and <hi>Lucidans</hi> attonement, and that he added, hee beleeved verily, his young Ladies misfortunes would end in a marriage with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> which being moſt earneſtly ſought by him, and as cloſely followed by <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> out of a deſire hee had to marry his ſonne unto <hi>Hippolita,</hi> it could not be refuſed by <hi>Caliſta,</hi> nor by her parents, principally in <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> abſence, who had witneſſed ſo little feeling of this laſt occaſion, that ſhee was extremely provoked. Then <hi>Liſander</hi> turning into tragicall the comicall ſubject of this newes, loſt, together with his ſtomacke to eat, all reſt and quiet in his minde, his very countenance changing, ſometimes red as ſcarlet, then pale as death, aſtoniſhed all the company with his ſudden alteration; yet all the company thought that it proceeded from weakeneſſe and paine of his wound in his arme, and counſelled him to goe to bed. But he well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this remedy was not apt for his evill, intreated this
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7258:115"/>
Gentleman to proceed in telling what hee knew of theſe Lovers, faigning that his griefe would be diverted by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe. I can ſay no more unto you, ſaid hee, but that this morning before I came away to goe to Bellaire, whither <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas</hi> hath ſent mee for money, hee together with <hi>Otranta</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s chamber to propound unto her the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageable conditions offered by <hi>Lucidan</hi>: one of which was, That the King promiſed in favour of this marriage, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to free her concerning <hi>Cleanders</hi> death. Beſides, they did not thinke it agreeable with <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s reputation to marry a man, who was accuſed of the death of her husband. But if he be innocent (ſaid <hi>Liſander</hi>) what then? It is all one (repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other) he is ſtill accuſed, and that leaveth an aſperſion, as a bite or a wound doth a ſcarre, although it be healed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is verily beleeved that <hi>Liſander</hi> is drowned at ſea, or that if hee be not, hee hath witneſſed ſo little affection unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> that ſhe ought not to thinke that ever there was any ſuch in the world. But is it poſsible (ſaid <hi>Liſander</hi>) that a Knight who hath ſaved <hi>Dorilas</hi> his life, and <hi>Lidians</hi> many times, and unto <hi>Caliſta</hi> both her life and honour, ſhould now be forgotten for <hi>Lucidan</hi>; who not onely was never their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but hath alwaies beene their capitall enemy? As for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> (anſwered the other) he holds for <hi>Liſander,</hi> and as well he as <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Berontus,</hi> will leave the kingdome, rather than be preſent at <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s marriage with <hi>Lucidan</hi>; and ſhe for her part hath not yet made any demonſtrations that ſhee doth incline either unto one part or other: but <hi>Dorilas, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus</hi> and <hi>Otranta</hi> doe ſtir heaven and earth for <hi>Lucidan,</hi> and which is greateſt, the King himſelfe favours the match, and he can doe more than all. All theſe words were like daggers at <hi>Liſanders</hi> heart, who being able to endure them no longer, bid all the company good night, and retiring into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, went to bed.</p>
            <p>While he reſts there (if a man tormented with ſo many fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can enjoy any reſt) we will returne unto <hi>Hippolita,</hi> who being recovered from her ſwound, and awake from a ſhort ſleepe, which a generall numming of all her ſpirits had brought upon her, not ſeeing her mortall enemy, who had ſo
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7258:116"/>
cruelly wounded her, whom nevertheleſſe ſhee loved more than ſhe loved her ſelfe, ſhee demanded of her maid where he was? Shee told her his going away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his excuſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How (ſaid ſhee) is hee gone without ſpeaking to mee? and hath hee thus left mee in this pitifull eſtate, whereunto I am brought by his cruelty? O Tiger! although I were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne unto him, I thinke meere humanity ſhould oblige him to ſtay with one afflicted; ſet apart that I am for his ſake, and by himſelfe thus wounded, and that deceived by his faigned affections, I am come into this countrey, moved by my true affection unto him, have preſerved his honour with the loſſe of my blood and the hazzard of my life: and if wee onely ſpeake of common good will which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moſt barbarous men, were not that bond enough upon him, to make him ſee the ſucceſſe of the wounds which he hath given me? Madam, ſaid <hi>Erifila,</hi> hee was ſo afflicted that it would rather have encreaſed your evill than leſſened it; and (therefore he went away, fearing that his ſight ſhould cauſe ſome alteration in your wounds. Afflicted, ſaid <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita</hi>! what proofe of affliction? haſt thou ſeene him ſhed one teare? or only fetch one ſigh for me? yet (<hi>Erifila</hi>) I muſt love him, and if thou alſo loveſt me, and wilt binde mee to love thee more, thou muſt ride ſpeedily after this ungratefull Knight, and conjure him not to flie from <hi>Hippolita,</hi> who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and would runne after him, if the wounds which hee hath given mee did not hinder me. Tell him I pretend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all that affection which hee hath vowed unto mee, but common good will, that I quit him of his promiſes, and that not only I will not conſtrain him in the love which hee beareth unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> but that I will mediate his peace with the King, and his marriage with her, and will take upon mee to ſolicite her againſt my ſelfe; let him vouchſafe onely to ſee mee, and ſuffer me but to accompany him. I am none of thoſe who have accuſed him for killing of <hi>Cleander,</hi> but cleane contrariwiſe, I am ſhe who have defended his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and for his ſake, his Ladies. But diſpatch <hi>Erifila,</hi> and reply not, if thou loveſt me, or if thou deſireſt I ſhould live. <hi>Erifila,</hi> who knew with what ſpirit ſhee had to doe,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7258:116"/>
ſaid onely ſhee would not ſtay, but would make ſuch haſte that ſhe would finde him, and ſhee would loſe her life, or bring him backe. But, Madam, ſaid ſhee againe, who ſhall have care of your wounds in my abſence? Care not you for my wounds, ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi> they are neither mortall nor dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, onely goe thy waies, and take heed thou doeſt not try <hi>Liſander</hi> in armes, for therein hee is no leſſe invincible, than in grace and comlineſſe incomparable. <hi>Erifila</hi> departeth (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were night) and upon a ſpeedy gallop followes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Liſander</hi>: where leaving her, there is a neceſſity now we ſhould relate what is done at Paris.</p>
            <p>Beſides the inſtant purſuits of <hi>Lucidan</hi> to marry with <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta, Veraſcus,</hi> who was advertiſed of the propoſitions which <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Adraſtus</hi> had made unto the King about <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> murder, and alſo what the King had ordained, as well upon their offers, as upon <hi>Berontus</hi> his declaration in favour of the accuſed; came Poſte to Paris, and addreſſing himſelfe unto the Court of Parliament, obtained a ſentence againſt <hi>Caliſta,</hi> containing, that moſt humble remonſtrances ſhould be made to his Majeſty, to be pleaſed, that juſtice might free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee executed upon the perſons of thoſe who were accuſed of <hi>Cleanders</hi> death: which ſentence being gravely pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, yet vainely, becauſe the King had already given his word; although they did not hide, that this crime ſcaping humane juſtice, could not ſcape divine, neither could this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood unjuſtly ſhed upon earth, crying vengeance in heaven, fall in any other place but upon his Majeſties head, or his childrens; <hi>Veraſcus</hi> addreſſeth himſelfe unto the King, and intreateth him to grant unto him the like combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who had offered to defend <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta,</hi> as he had granted unto <hi>Lucidan</hi>; a requeſt not onely juſt, but alſo favourable: for beſides that the combate granted to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidan</hi> ſerved him as a prejudged caſe, there was no reaſon to deny or refuſe <hi>Veraſcus</hi> upon a cauſe already judged, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt perſons condemned, having ſuffered it unto <hi>Lucidan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man who was not in apparance: furthermore, hee required nothing but what the friends of the adverſe part had already demanded, and beſides the cauſe of his kinſman,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7258:117"/>
for whoſe juſtice he ſued, hee was injured in his honour by <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s words: The King granted that which in juſtice hee could not deny. Thus was <hi>Adraſtus</hi> his life and <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s honour once againe in tryall, and all the joy of the dayes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed turned into griefe and deſolation; <hi>Lidian, Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Berontus</hi> were all mad to diſpute this difference with <hi>Veraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> who in all their opinions, was like diſcord let looſe by envie out of hell, to trouble all their quiet. But God forbid, ſaid <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> that any other but my ſelfe, being in health and preſent, ſhould undertake the defence of my ſonne and of my owne offer: I have demanded this combate againſt <hi>Veraſcus,</hi> and (if it pleaſe God) I wilbe the firſt that ſhall maintain the innocency which hee would oppreſſe. Who is able to utter <hi>Dorilas</hi> his anger, <hi>Otranta</hi>'s complaints, <hi>Ambriſia</hi>'s griefe, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>'s teares, <hi>Argires</hi> ſorrow, and the deadly confuſion of unfortunate <hi>Caliſta</hi>? who can declare <hi>Lidians</hi> fury, to ſee his ſiſters cauſe and his friends, hazzarded under the defence of a feeble old man, whoſe age might juſtly bee diſpenſed from Armes? finally, who can ſpeake the univerſall diſcomfort of all? For beſides <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s and <hi>Liſanders</hi> intereſt, which was common amongſt them, every one had a feeling of his owne particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Lucidan</hi> to ſee himſelfe fruſtrate of his hope to marry <hi>Caliſta</hi> if her Father were vanquiſhed by <hi>Veraſcus, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontus</hi> to ſee himſelfe deprived of his marriage with <hi>Ambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and <hi>Alcidon</hi> to ſee his alſo with <hi>Argire</hi> to bee deferred, there being no hope to marry in the calamity of two perſons ſo deere unto him, as was <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta.</hi> So that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſcus</hi> was univerſally curſed of all: yet the combate being granted, it was publiſhed that very day, and aſsigned three dayes after in the ſame place, and with the ſame Armes as had beene appointed unto <hi>Lucidan</hi>; the King reſerving unto himſelfe the judgement of the cauſe after the combate was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liſander</hi> in the meane time having ſpent the night in the greateſt trouble of minde that ever hee was in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continually meditating what meanes hee might uſe to undoe the knot of his love, which was ſo intangled that he could finde no end, about breake of day roſe with <hi>Leon</hi> with purpoſe to goe to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7258:117"/>
Paris, and hoping by his preſence to give ſtop unto <hi>Lucidans</hi> further ſuite, or elſe to fight with him rather upon that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell than about <hi>Chriſantes</hi> his death. But as he was ready to get up on horſebacke, <hi>Erifila</hi> came, who having poſted all night, and comming unto Pontoiſe upon the opening of the gates, ſhe met him even as he was going away, and having delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the charge which her Miſtreſſe had given her, to finde him, and to intreat him to come backe unto her who did but deſire to ſee him; the trouble and perplexity of his minde redoubled ſo upon him, that hee became dumbe and immoveable as a ſtatue: Of the one ſide, he ſaw it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable ungratitude to refuſe the going back ſeven or eight leagues to ſee one, who had come two hundred for his ſake, had fought in his quarrell againſt <hi>Lucidan,</hi> &amp; afterwards had offered to fight againſt thoſe who did accuſe him for killing <hi>Cleander</hi>: Furthermore, ſuch a perſon as <hi>Hippolita</hi> was, who ſeeking him after ſo many obligations, hee had in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence doubly offended, both in words which he had ſpoke, and by thoſe blowes which hee had made, and now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe her in ſo pitifull a plight, whereunto he had brought her he thought it was a cruell diſcourteſie, extremely contrary to his nature: Of the other ſide, ſetting before him <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, the ſtrange courſes which this paſsion had enforced her unto, the combate which ſhee had enterpriſed for him, then when ſhe beleeved that hee had left her, with ſo much more danger unto her than unto <hi>Hippolita,</hi> by how much ſhe was leſſe practiſed in armes than <hi>Hippolita,</hi> and with ſo much the more merit, by how much ſhe thought ſhe fought for an enemy, againſt a ſervant by whom ſhee was ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The letter which ſhee had written upon the ſubject of this jealouſie, and the diſpleaſure which ſhee would receive when ſhee underſtood that hee was now with her Rivall: The freſh newes of <hi>Adrastuſſes</hi> and <hi>Dorilaſſes</hi> labouring to marry her with <hi>Lucidan,</hi> and the meanes which hee had to breake it off, and to ſerve her both in juſtifying himſelfe and her by <hi>Leons</hi> owne mouth, and by this laſt obligation to ſurpaſſe all his former, which hee could not defer without great danger of loſing all. All theſe reaſons together, making
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7258:118"/>
the ballance weigh downe in favour of <hi>Caliſta,</hi> made him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat <hi>Erifila</hi> to pardon him, and to excuſe him to her Miſtres if the neceſſity of his affairs, which had ſo long called him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court, hindered him from doing this ſmall ſervice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt ſenſible and moſt violent of all his ſorrow. God never be helpfull unto me, anſwered <hi>Erifila,</hi> if I doe not kill my ſelfe rather here in your preſence, than ſuffer you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo great a fault; what, would you kill her? for I am ſure the deſpite which ſhe will receive by this deniall can worke no leſſe: Is this the recompence of all the dangers wherunto ſhe hath expoſed her ſelf, of the travell which ſhe hath taken, and of the evill which ſhe hath ſuffered for you? Doe not doe your ſelfe, Sir, this wrong: I conjure you by that which you owe unto the greatneſſe of your courage, and to the glory of ſo many brave and generous actions which you have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not to refuſe her, for I aſſure you if you doe, you will for ever wither with a reproach of an eternall infamy: I promiſe you, you ſhall not ſtay, and ſo farre will ſhe be from conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you in the affection which you beare unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> that contrariwiſe ſhe will ſerve you; wherefore give this content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto one, who doth perfectly love you, and who for all acknowledgment of the love which ſhe beares, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the injury which you have done her, demandeth onely but this fight.</p>
            <p>While ſhe thus ſpake, a Poſte comming from Paris, was knowne by <hi>Dorilas</hi> his man, who had ſupped over night with <hi>Liſander</hi>: he asking in <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Erifila</hi>'s hearing of newes from the Court, was told the combate which was to bee fought betweene <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and <hi>Veraſcus</hi> about <hi>Cleanders</hi> death. Will you have any more lawfull excuſes, ſaid <hi>Liſander</hi> unto <hi>Erifila</hi>? muſt I without any feeling of my honour, or of <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s (which ought to be more deere unto mee) ſuffer my father to hazzard his life in my quarrell, while I fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trifle out time in contenting <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s idle humour? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if I could ſerve her to her deſire, what profit could I bring her, unleſſe it bee a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

dayes: and never thinke that ſhee who hath come ſo long a journey to defend your honour here in your abſence, will now counſell you to loſe it here before your eyes, or ſuffer you to doe ſo, if you were willing. Let us goe then, replied <hi>Liſander,</hi> vanquiſhed with her importunity, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you preſſe mee not to ſtay, but that immediately after I have ſeene her, I may returne my way: upon theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hee followes <hi>Erifila</hi> with his company, and came unto the Village where <hi>Hippolita</hi> lay wounded. To tell you the diſcourſe which ſhee faſhioned unto her ſelfe in <hi>Erifila</hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, thoſe which were made at her returne, as well by her as by <hi>Liſander,</hi> the ſhame that both of them had when they ſaw one the other, one remembring what he had ſaid, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what ſhe had heard ſpoken; it is not poſſible: At the firſt they onely beheld one another without ſpeech, thinking that their lookes could better expreſſe their thoughts than words. In the end, <hi>Liſander</hi> going about to ſpeake firſt, was ſo confounded, that the more hee endeavoured to expreſſe himſelfe, the leſſe he was underſtood: <hi>Hippolita</hi> judging the confuſion of his minde by that of his words, and ſeeing his aſtoniſhment in his face, was more ſatisfied to ſee the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and trouble which ſhee raiſed in this great courage, than with all the excuſes and ſubmiſſions which hee could make; and receiving this perplexity for a teſtimony of his ſorrow, reſolved to pardon him: whereupon cleering the beams of her face, which griefe and danger had darkned, and beholding him with a more pleaſing eye than ſhee had done at the firſt entrance, ſhe looſened his tongue whereby he had power to utter theſe words: Madam, I take heaven to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it was force, and not will which hath conſtrained me to offend you, and that now it is will, &amp; not force, which bringeth mee, for your ſatisfaction, to offer you my life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating you to do it ſo much honor, as to think it worthy of your revenge: I could wiſh that I had ſomething more deare unto me, if by the loſſe thereof you might be better ſatisfied: But ſeeing I have nothing, whereof I can diſpoſe, more deere unto me than my life, &amp; ſince that hath committed the fault, I doe entreate you to ſacrifice it to your anger, and receive
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7258:119"/>
this voluntary reparation of a conſtrained injury. Ah <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> anſwered <hi>Hippolita,</hi> you have much more grace than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in excuſing the wrongs which you have done: but tell mee, I pray you, what hath miſerable <hi>Hippolita</hi> done unto you, that you ſhould ſo poorely betray her facility? for I doe not bewaile the wounds which I have exacted from you, nor your words, which ſtrength of paſsion and of truth, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged you to ſpeake unto me, thinking you had ſpoken unto <hi>Caliſta</hi>: But of thoſe which from a free motion you have of your owne accord uttered, falſly perſwading me that you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lived for mee. It is true, Madam, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> that I have ſpoken ſomething of love unto you, preſſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and authority of my parents, who much deſired that I ſhould ſerve you; but never out of any free motion as you have beleeved: for not onely then, but long time before I had the honour to ſee you, I was promiſed unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caliſta</hi> unto mee: But though her abſence, and the object of your preſent beauty, ſhould have wrought mee unto it, yet had it not beene from a free motion, but conſtrained by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a paſsion which you cauſe in many others; And am I (thinke you) beyond others ſo free from paſsion, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſubject unto it? Is it a crime to love a thing ſo lovely? Am I the onely man in the world who at divers times in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places hath ſerved two Miſtreſſes? or rather, was there ever Knight, that hath loved but one Lady? It is no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your crime (replied <hi>Hippolita</hi>) to alledge examples of others infidelity, but contrariwiſe it is an inwrapping of their faults with yours, and a charging your ſelfe with them for the ſame evill. You are a better Knight, than a faithfull Lover, in this time, when it is a bravery amongſt many to ſport themſelves with the love of Ladies: you have let mee ſee heretofore the quickeneſſe of your ſpirit, but I did never ſo plainely diſcerne it as in this occaſion, wherein you want no faire words &amp; good reaſons, at the leaſt in appearance, to colour ſo evill a cauſe: I am ſorry you have no better, that I might have leſſe cauſe to complaine of you, and more to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you. But an offence of this nature is not ſo eaſily juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as committed, yet I thinke you have one reaſon which
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7258:119"/>
your diſcretion concealeth, I ſee I muſt utter it my ſelf againſt my ſelfe, that is, the ſubject for which you leave mee, is of ſuch perfection, that ſhe meriteth not only an excuſe for you, but alſo that you ſhould bee commended for ſo worthy a choice; for although you had loved me before you ſaw her, as you loved her before you ſaw mee, and that you were the faithfulleſt lover that ever had name, yet ſhee hath charmes enough to make you loſe your conſtancy, and to make you ungratefull and perfidious to all the world, to bee conſtant and acknowledging unto her only: and this comfort (at the leaſt) remaines unto me, that if you have left me, it is for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who doth merit it, and whoſe beauty incomparably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all others, doth leſſen the ſorrow &amp; the ſhame which I may conceive for her being preferred before me: yet one thing I would intreat of you, which is, that though I have loſt your affection, you would nevertheleſſe preſerve unto mee your good will, and aſſure your ſelfe, that you may well bee poſſeſſed by ſome other, but I ſhall onely be yours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liſander</hi> no leſſe raviſhed with the beauties than with the ſpirit and judgement of <hi>Hippolita,</hi> could not anſwer but with ſighes, and offering her his humble ſervice with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect friendſhip, ſorrowing that hee could not give himſelfe unto her, being not his owne. <hi>Erifila</hi> then ſeeing them in this faire way of agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſaid unto her, Madam, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed this Knight that he ſhould returne this day, to eaſe his Father of a combate which he is to have with <hi>Veraſcus,</hi> but hee may be there time enough although he come but to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. How? (anſwered <hi>Hippolita</hi>) is there a combate aſsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betweene <hi>Adraſtus</hi> and <hi>Veraſcus.</hi> I, Madam, replied <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fila,</hi> who preſently told what they had learned of the Poſte in paſsing by at Pointoiſe. Upon my honour (ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi>) it ſhall not goe ſo: It is I, who have made the firſt overture, and <hi>Adraſtus</hi> can be but my ſecond, if there be two accuſers, and there being but one, it is I who muſt make the battaile. I, Madam, anſwered <hi>Liſander,</hi> if I were not preſent, but all being enterpriſed upon my occaſion, and in my abſence, it is not reaſonable, that I being preſent, any other ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my right. Beſides, I have <hi>Leon</hi> here who will depoſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7258:120"/>
my innocency, who being heard, I doe not thinke any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate will be neceſſary, unleſſe it be between him and mee, if hee will denie the truth which he hath confeſſed. I will tell you what we will doe, ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi>; to morrow I ſhall bee able (notwithſtanding my wounds) to goe in two dayes to Paris; for by your onely comming, I finde my ſelfe almoſt well, and we will appeare all together. A thouſand other faire words ſaid they amongſt themſelves, which I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat: but to be ſhort, after the day was ſpent, and a good part of the night in this manner, the next morning they roſe very early to goe to Paris, as they had determined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s wounds were the cauſe they could not come thither before the day of the combate, which was already begun. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> of one ſide, and <hi>Veraſcus</hi> of the other, were both come into the field; the firſt in his armes whoſe colour and device we have already ſpoken of, and the other in taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie armour, having for his device an Auſtridge, holding an horſe ſhoe in the mouth, with this word, <hi>Sic nutriantur fortes.</hi> He was followed by all <hi>Cleanders</hi> kinſmen, excepting <hi>Beron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who would not be there, neither for one nor other. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus</hi> was accompanied with <hi>Dorilas, Lidian, Alcidon, Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and many others. They were both couragious &amp; ſtrong, and witneſſed in their armes great fierceneſſe, as thoſe who in their youth had atchieved many memorable adventures. The royall Scaffold was furniſhed with their Majeſties, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a great Court, beſides which, there was an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite company of others, who did inviron the whole field, and upon one ſide was <hi>Caliſta</hi> all in mourning, accompanied with <hi>Otranta, Olinda, Ambriſia</hi> and <hi>Argire,</hi> and miſerable <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> alone upon the other. Already was the Sunne equally divided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Trumpets ſounding the charge, the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne one againſt another with great violence, breaking their Launces to their hands, and remaining with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advantage, had perfected their careere: And as they were returning, with their ſwords ſhining in their hands, every one looking ſtedfaſtly upon them without ſtirring an eie, and ſilent without a word; <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Liſander,</hi> together with <hi>Erifila</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> came into the field, which drew the eyes of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7258:120"/>
all the company upon them. At their firſt entrance there was raiſed a little noiſe, like a gentle murmuring, proceeding from this infinite world of people, whereof ſome knowing <hi>Hippolita</hi> by the Armes which ſhee wore, raiſed this gentle noiſe. In the end, ſeeing they went directly to ſpeake unto the King, and every one being deſirous to heare what they would ſay, there was an univerſall ſilence (a thing rarely happening in ſo great a multitude) during which, <hi>Hippolita</hi> having intreated his Majeſty to ſtay the combate, and to cauſe the combatants, together with <hi>Caliſta</hi> and <hi>Clarinda,</hi> to be brought neere; ſhee ſpake in this manner: Sir, I am <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Knight, who firſt had the lot to maintaine his cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lucidan,</hi> and who firſt have offered to defend it againſt <hi>Veraſcus. Adraſtus,</hi> unto whom you have permitted it in my abſence, being but my ſecond, cannot be received but after mee: But, Sir, before this difference be decided, and that all men may know with what juſtice I have undertaken the defence of the accuſed, I do humbly intreat you to heare what this Knight can ſay concerning <hi>Cleanders</hi> death. Saying this, <hi>Hippolita</hi> preſented <hi>Liſander,</hi> who pulling off his Helmet, and doing humble reverence unto the King, hee filled all the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants with wonder and aſtoniſhment.

this, wherein they found her in ſo great glory. <hi>Liſander</hi> could not tell which way to turne him, ſo much hee was buſied, ſometime in ſpeaking to the King, ſometime to his father, and by and by to entertaine his friends: yet in the end getting from them, and going to kneele downe before <hi>Caliſta,</hi> ſhee turned from him unto <hi>Lucidan,</hi> who was neere her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to entertaine him with ſpeech, not ſaluting or ſo much as looking upon <hi>Liſander.</hi> And from hence I gather that all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (for the moſt part) have a ſpirit of contradiction, and ſo ſtrange and ſo unequall a humour, that no judgement or knowledge can be ſettled of them; for who can otherwiſe ſay, ſeeing <hi>Caliſta,</hi> the ornament of her ſexe, leap over wals af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Liſander,</hi> then when her husbands death, her owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, her parents authority, and <hi>Liſanders</hi> love with <hi>Hippolita</hi> might have juſtified her ingratitude, and now when nothing could excuſe her, after ſuch extreme obligations, ſuch preſent and ſignall ſervices, to turne her backe unto him when hee offered himſelfe?

            <p>But as meates wherewith one eates in health unto a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in ſickeneſſe are many times abhorred, ſo the extreme and violent love which ſhe bore unto <hi>Liſander</hi> being abſent, turned at the ſeeing him into hatred; and remembring the follies which the paſſion of this man had made her commit, ſhe was aſhamed, and wiſhed him evill, for the ſame cauſe for which ſhe had wiſhed himſelfe well: furthermore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous of <hi>Hippolita,</hi> as ſhee was, and ſeeing her come with him; ſhe thought he did not much care for diſpleaſing her, ſince hee durſt appeare before her in the company of a

            <p>But when <hi>Adraſtus</hi> would ſpeake of it unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> thinking to rejoice him in bringing ſo good news, for which not long ſince hee would have given the Monarchy of the whole world, he was aſtoniſhed at his anſwer, which was, That having run ſo dangerous a fortune at Sea, he had made a vow to God, that if he had the bleſsing to eſcape, he would goe in pilgrimage unto Rome, wherunto being more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound by his finding <hi>Leon,</hi> and the happy iſſue of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; he intreated him that he might performe his vow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he contracted any marriage: And in the ſame time <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi> anſwered <hi>Dorilas,</hi> upon the propoſition which was made unto her of marriage with <hi>Liſander,</hi> That being in the Abbey of Longchampe, afflicted with ſo many adverſities, God had ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir, you having ſetled order in the eſtate, ought alſo to do the like in families, and as you are a great father of the kingdome, exacting obedience, &amp; maintaining the pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall authority of the Royalty; ſo I hope you will, and we do humbly entreat you to render the ancient power of fathers over their children who will not obey.</p>
            <p>The end of theſe complaints were not leſſe pleaſing unto <hi>Liſander,</hi> than the beginning had beene diſpleaſing, ſeeing they concluded in the marriage of <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who ſilent, yet with lookes full of pity and love upon him, hee ſpake in this manner: Sir, it cannot be denied but that my fathers words are moſt true, and if I had yeelded all kind of obedience unto him, yet his benefits and fatherly goodneſſe are ſo great unto me, that I ought not to be ungratefull; although I cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, yet Sir, if I have but deferred and not refuſed his commandements, the injury is not irreparable; wherefore I doe humbly entreat your clemency and his to forgive mee, upon condition I repaire my fault. And you faire one, ſaid the King then unto <hi>Caliſta,</hi> what anſwer make you unto your fathers complaint? <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſeeing things brought to the point which ſhee did deſire, and being glad that her fathers command, or rather the Kings, might conſtraine her to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Liſander,</hi> and to marry him, abſolutely beleeving that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one or the other of them two would compell her (as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7258:125"/>
Ladies would faine be forced in thoſe occaſions, and doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yeeld but with ſome ſhew of conſtraint) anſwered in this manner: Sir, it is a complaint which I renew every day in my ſoule, and one of the greateſt evils wherewith my minde is afflicted, that ever I ſhould be the cauſe of ſorrow unto my parents. But that which comforteth me, Sir, is the aſſurance which I have in my heart, that your Majeſty and they themſelves doe cleerly ſee, that it is rather my evill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than my fault. And as unto the diſobedience, whereof they complaine, I have yeelded it as fully as ever any daughter in this world did, excepting onely in one point, from which the condition of my widowhood, &amp; a thouſand other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I cannot ſpeak of, do diſpenſe me. And Sir, though there were no other reaſon but my will, having once ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me unto theirs, they ſhall force me to ſubmit if I do again in ſo unreaſonable a matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caliſta</hi> ſaid this, beleeving that the King would have more reſpect unto <hi>Adraſtus</hi> his requeſt and unto <hi>Dorilas,</hi> than unto any reaſons which ſhe ſhould bring: but ſhe was deceived, and did quickely repent her of this laſt folly; for the King wiſely judging that nothing in the world ought to bee freer than marriage, nor that any thing was ſo contrary unto the liberty thereof as violence, diſmiſſed the two fathers from the power which in this caſe they demanded over their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <hi>Caliſta,</hi> becauſe ſhe had beene once married at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, &amp; <hi>Liſander,</hi> becauſe he was not bound to obey his in a matter impoſsible; exhorting nevertheleſſe to obey him in any other thing. This ſentence being pronounced by ſuch a King, <hi>Caliſta</hi> was diſappointed, the parents confounded, and <hi>Liſander</hi> deſparate, who caſting himſelfe at his Ladies feete, with teares in his eyes, ſpake in this manner: I ſee that after ſo many labours and hazzards, for a reward of my fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which is beyond that of all lovers, I muſt finde ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in a heart which hath alwaies promiſed me never to be capable thereof; and that for having adored you, I ſuffer ſuch uſage as I ſhould have deſerved if I had done the contrary. I will not diſpute with you whether it be with juſtice, for that were to ſeeke reaſon in love; and your will holding in mee
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7258:125"/>
the place of reaſon and law, doth binde me to beleeve againſt my proper feeling, that what you doe is juſt: but if you do not thinke that the ſervices which I have done are injuries, I doe moſt humbly entreat you, Madam, to tell mee here in this moſt illuſtrious company, what offence I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and let not my condition be worſe than that of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall perſons, unto whom the cauſe of their puniſhment is (at the leaſt) told before they ſuffer any: And if I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent my ſervices here, it is not to reproach you, but to ſhew that in ſerving you, I have not beene ſo unhappy as to offend you. You may thinke what you pleaſe, but I muſt needes thinke, that you might better have acknowledged them, than I could better have addreſſed them; and God forbid, Madam, that ever I ſhould complaine the time which I have loſt in your ſervice, ſince it hath bin emploied according unto my intention, which was to honour you. It is true, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that herein I have done but my duty, yet I do not know that I have committed any fault; and it is no ſmall matter to pay all that one owes, eſpecially unto one unto whom all is owing; nevertheleſſe, ſince together with the eternall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which you have ſo ſolemnely promiſed, I muſt loſe the greateſt happines that ever I hoped for in this world, I will leave with you (if you pleaſe) this remembrance of you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that he is not ſorry he hath ſuffered ſo much, and is glad he hath not deſerved this ſuffering. Live therefore ſatisfied and contented with my misfortune, and beleeve it ſhall be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto mee in all my miſeries, to heare that they doe bring you contentment. I only ask your permiſsion to endure them, and to honour you at the leaſt in holding my peace, and in hiding in the ſecret of my heart that which you cannot take away but in appearance. To conclude, Madam, I will not complaine of you, but of my fortune which maketh your pitty dumbe, and changeth your nature without changing my affection, thereby ſhewing that it is not ſubject unto the change of her wheele. And I ſhould think my ſelfe unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if in this my complaint, I did not give her thankes, that by my deſtiny being reſerved unto ſuch cruell miſchiefes, ſhe hath ordained, that they ſhould come from your hand, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,

whoſe cruelty I have loved more than my life, and whoſe deſpiſing I doe honour in the pangs of death, doe me this laſt office, and beare this pitifull teſtimony of your Knight, That he had lived longer, if he had beene leſſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>This his long ſpeech ended with their Majeſties incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patience, who were pleaſed to heare him, and no leſſe diſquiet in <hi>Liſanders</hi> friends, who feared he would never get out to his advantage. It was a pleaſant ſpectacle to ſee them in one inſtant to ſhed teares for joy, <hi>Liſander</hi> for love, and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi> out of pity, upon whoſe anſwer depended the miſery or happineſſe of their lives; who having conſulted ſome time with her ſelfe, her heart inflamed with love, &amp; her face with ſhame, in the end anſwered in this manner: It is true, moſt deare <hi>Liſander,</hi> that I have promiſed you never to be capable of ingratitude; and if I have beene ſo untill this time (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the cauſe which you have given me) I will not be ſo now, you having taken the cauſe away. Wherfore pardon me the evils which you have ſuffered, ſeeing that I my ſelfe firſt felt them, and in reſpect they will ſerve to be ſo many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of your fidelity, &amp; will make the injoying which we ſhall have one of the other, ſo much the ſweeter, by how much we have indured the more. And ſeeing their Majeſties do ſuffer me, my parents command me, &amp; your ſervices do oblige me, I do confirme in this moſt excellent preſence and aſſembly, the oath which particularly I have made unto you, that I will be onely yours.</p>
            <p>In ſaying this <hi>Caliſta</hi> gave him her hand, which he moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſly kiſſed, bleſſing the evils which hee had ſuffered for ſo great a good. And the contentment of theſe two lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, not being able to bee contained in themſelves, ſpread through all the company, renewing imbracings with joy, which was then pure, without any mixture of ſorrow or feare, if this word Joy be not too weake a word to expreſſe the feelings which cannot be ſpoken, hardly comprehended. Who can tell the divers motions of ſo many perſons, who had a part in this common rejoycing? <hi>Veraſcus</hi> his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Berontus</hi> his admiration, as alſo of <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidan</hi>?

who can ſpeake of the infinite pleaſure of <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Lidian,</hi> of <hi>Olinda</hi> and <hi>Argire,</hi> of <hi>Ambriſia</hi> and <hi>Otranta,</hi> and the unſpeakable pleaſure of <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Adraſtus</hi>? Theſe two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having long embraced <hi>Liſander</hi> &amp; <hi>Caliſta,</hi> ſnatching them one from another, and imbracing them between them with teares, as thoſe who after a dangerous ſtorme, having eſcaped ſhipwracke, doe meet upon the dry land in uncredible joy: To increaſe which, <hi>Liſander</hi> knowing the love which <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> bore unto <hi>Hippolita,</hi> moſt humbly entreated the King to marry them together, and after turning to <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> made the like requeſt unto him, in favour of <hi>Berontus</hi> and <hi>Ambriſia.</hi> Then looking unto <hi>Argire</hi> and <hi>Alcidon, Lidian</hi> and <hi>Olinda,</hi> he entreated them that as they had ſuffered great griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with him, ſo they would honour him ſo much, as to let one day give an end unto all their troubles, and one day by marriage a beginning unto their joyes.</p>
            <p>By this meanes the Marriages were reſolved to bee in one day finiſhed between <hi>Alcidon</hi> and <hi>Argire, Lidian</hi> and <hi>Olinda,</hi> of <hi>Lucidan</hi> and <hi>Hippolita,</hi> of <hi>Berontus</hi> and <hi>Ambriſia,</hi> and of brave <hi>Liſander</hi> and <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who humbly taking leave of their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, retired all together to <hi>Dorilas</hi> and <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> who, as we have ſaid, had but one houſe, where after a magnifick ſupper, they gave themſelves unto their reſts, expecting the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with longing; which being come, all of them moſt rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparelled, eſpecially <hi>Caliſta,</hi> who having ever ſince <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> death neglected her attire, now (richly beſet with jewels, and with that rich collar which <hi>Liſander</hi> had conquered in great Britaine) drew all the eyes of the beholders upon her with admiration.
